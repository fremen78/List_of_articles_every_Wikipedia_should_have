Alumeenium is a chemical element in the boron group wi seembol Al an atomic nummer 13. It is a sillery white, saft, ductile metal. Alumeenium is the third maist abundant element (efter oxygen an silicon), an the maist abundant metal, in the Yird's crust. It maks up aboot 8% bi wicht o the Yird's solit surface. Alumeenium metal is sae chemically reactive that native specimens are rare an leemitit tae extreme reducing environments. Instead, it is foond combined in ower 270 different minerals. The chief ore o alumeenium is bauxite.
Alumeenium is remarkable for the metal's law density an for its ability tae resist corrosion due tae the phenomenon o passivation. Structural components made frae alumeenium an its alloys are vital tae the aerospace industry an are important in ither auries o transportation an structural materials. The maist uiseful compounds o alumeenium, at least on a wicht basis, are the oxides an sulfates.
Despite its prevalence in the environment, alumeenium salts are nae kent tae be uised bi ony fairm o life. In keepin wi its pervasiveness, alumeenium is well toleratit bi plants an ainimals. Owin tae thair prevalence, potential beneficial (or itherwise) biological roles o aluminium compounds are o continuin interest.
