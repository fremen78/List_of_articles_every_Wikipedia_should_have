A trumpet is a muisical instrument. It is the heichest register in the brass faimily. Trumpets are amang the auldest musical instruments, datin back tae at least 1500 BC. Thay are played bi blawin air through closed lips, producin a "buzzin" soond that stairts a staundin wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument. Syne the late 15t century thay hae primarily been constructit o brass tubin, uisually bent twice intae a roondit oblong shape.
Thare are several types o trumpet. The maist common is a transposin instrument pitched in Bâ™­ wi a tubin length o aboot 148 cm. Earlier trumpets did nae hae valves, but modren instruments generally hae either three piston valves or, mair rarely, three rotary valves. Each valve increases the length o tubin when engaged, tharebi lawerin the pitch.
A muisician who plays the trumpet is cried a trumpet player or trumpeter.
