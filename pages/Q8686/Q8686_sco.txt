== Etymology an Names ==
The twa Cheenese characters in the ceety's name are 上 (shàng) 'abuin' an 海 (hǎi) 'sea' which thegither literally mean 'Upper Sea'. The earliest occurrence o this name dates frae the Song Dynasty (11t century), at which time there wis awready a river confluence an a toun wi this name in the aurie. There are disputes as tae exactly hou the name shoud be interpretit, but offeecial local histories hae consistently said that it signifies 'The upper reaches o the sea'. Due tae the changin coastline, Cheenese historians hae concludit that in the Tang Dynasty Shanghai wis literally on the sea, hence the oreegin o the name. Anither readin an aa suggests the sense o "go ontae the sea," which is consistent wi the seaport status o the ceety. A mair poetic name for Shanghai switches the order o the twa characters, Hǎishàng (海上), an is aften uised for terms relatit tae Shanghainese airt an cultur.
Shanghai is commonly abbreviatit in Cheenese as Hù (simp: 沪/trad: 滬). This character appears on aw motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today. This is derived frae Hu Du (simp: 沪渎/trad: 滬瀆), the name o an ancient fishin village that ance stood at the confluence o Suzhou Creek an the Huangpu River back in the Tang Dynasty. The character Hu is aften combined wi that for Song, as in Wusong Kou, Wu Song River, an Songjiang tae form the nickname Song Hu. For example, the Japanese attack on Shanghai in August 1937 is commonly cawed the Song Hu Battle. Anither early name for Shanghai wis Hua Ting, nou juist the name o a fower star hotel in the ceety. Ane ither commonly uised nickname Shēn (申) is derived frae the name o Chunshen Jun (春申君), a nobleman an locally revered hero o the Chu Kinrick in the 3rd century BC whose territory includit the Shanghai aurie. Sports teams an newspapers in Shanghai aften use the character Shēn (申) in their names. Shanghai is an aa commonly cawed Shēnchéng (申城, "Ceety o Shēn").
