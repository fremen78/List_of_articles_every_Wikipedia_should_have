Electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation or EMR) is ane o the fundamental phenomena o electromagnetism, behavin as waves propagatin through space, an an aa as photon pairticles travelin through space, carryin radiant energy. In a vacuum, it propagates at a characteristic speed, the speed o licht, normally in straicht lines.  EMR is emitted an absorbed bi charged pairticles. As an electromagnetic wave, it haes baith electric an magnetic field components, which oscillate in a fixed relationship tae ane anither, perpendicular tae ilk ither an perpendicular tae the direction o energy an wave propagation.
