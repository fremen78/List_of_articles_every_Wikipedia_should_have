4B3T, which stands for 4 (four) binary 3 (three) ternary, is a line encoding scheme used for ISDN PRI interface. 4B3T represents four binary bits using three pulses.


== Description ==
It uses three output levels:

+ (positive pulse),
0 (no pulse), and
− (negative pulse).
This means we have 24 = 16 input combinations to represent, using 33 = 27 output combinations. 000 is not used to avoid long periods without a transition. 4B3T uses a paired disparity code to achieve an overall zero DC bias: six triplets are used which have no DC component (0+−, 0−+, +0−, −0+, +−0, −+0), and the remaining 20 are grouped into 10 pairs with differing disparity (e.g. ++− and −−+).  When transmitting, the DC bias is tracked and a combination chosen that has a DC component of the opposite sign to the running total.
This mapping from 4 bits to three ternary states is given in a table known as Modified Monitoring State 43 (MMS43).
A competing encoding technique, used for the ISDN basic rate interface where 4B3T is not used, is 2B1Q.
The sync sequence used is the 11-symbol Barker code, +++−−−+−−+− or its reverse, −+−−+−−−+++.


== Encoding table ==
Each 4-bit input group is encoded as a 3-symbol group (transmitted left to right) from the following table.
Encoding requires keeping track of the accumulated DC offset, the number of + pulses minus the number of − pulses in all preceding groups.  The starting value is arbitrary; here we use the values 1 through 4, although −1.5, −0.5, +0.5 and +1.5 is another possibility.

This code forces a transition after at most five consecutive identical non-zero symbols, or four consecutive zero symbols.


== Decoding table ==
Decoding is simpler, as the decoder does not need to keep track of the encoder state, although doing so allows greater error detection.  The 000 triplet is not a legal encoded sequence, but is typically decoded as binary 0000.


== 8B/6T ==
A similar paired-disparity code was used in the short-lived 100BASE-T4 Fast Ethernet standard.  This achieved the same ratio of 4/3 bits per baud while needing to keep track of only two levels of accumulated DC offset by using a larger 256-entry coding table.  6 ternary symbols allow 140 balanced codes (30 permutations of +0000−, 90 permutations of ++00−−, and 20 permutations of +++−−−), and 126 codes with disparity +1 (6 permutations of +00000, 60 permutations of ++000−, and 60 permutations of +++0−−).  The codes with disparity +1 are inverted whenever the running disparity is high.  From the total of 266 code words, 256 are used as follows:
