Telly, televeesion or TV, is a telecommunication medium uised for transmittin muivin eemages in monochrome (black an white), or in colour, an in twa or three dimensions an soond. The term can refer tae a telly itsel, a telly programme ("TV shaw"), or the medium o transmission for telly. The telly is a mass medium for divert, eddication, news, politics, clavers an advertisin.
Telly becam appen tae uise in crude experimental furms in the late 1920s, but it wad still be several year afore the new technology wis mercatit tae consumers. Efter Warld War II, an impruived furm o black-an-white TV braidcastin becam faur ben in the Unitit States an Breetain, an telly sets becam cowmon in hames, businesses, an institutions. In the 1950s, telly wis the main medium for influencin public opeenion. In the mid-1960s, colour braidcastin wus introduced in the US an maist ither developit kintras. The availability o multiple teeps o storage media lik Betamax, VHS tape, local disks, DVDs, flash drives, heich-defineetion Blu-ray Discs, an deegital video recorders haes enabled viewers tae watch prerecordit material — lik films — at hame on thair ain time schedule. For mony raisons, telly an video programmin storage occurs on the clood thir days. At the end o the first decade o the 2000s, deegital televeesion transmissions gey an waxt in popularity. Anither development wis the muive frae staunart-defineetion telly (SDTV) (576i, wi 576 interlaced lines o resolution an 480i) tae heich-defineetion televeesion (HDTV), that provides a resolution that is substantially heicher. HDTV mey be transmittit in various formats: 1080p, 1080i an 720p. Syne 2010, wi the invention o smairt television, Internet televeesion haes increased telly programme an film appenin via the Internet throu streamin video services lik Netflix, Amazon Video, iPlayer, Hulu, Roku an Chromecast.
In 2013, 79% o the warld's hoosehauds awned a telly set. The replacement o early bouky, heich-voltage cathode ray tube (CRT) screen displays wi saddit, smeddum-eydent, flat-panel alternative technologies lik plasma displays, LCDs (baith fluorescent-backlit an LED), an OLED displays wis a haurdweirs revolution that begoud wi computer monitors in the late 1990s. Maist televeesions selt in the 2000s war flat-panel, mainly LEDs. Major manufacturers annoonced the discontinuation o CRT, DLP, plasma, an even fluorescent-backlit LCDs bi the mid-2010s. In the near futur, LEDs is expectit tae be gradually replaced bi OLEDs. On the tap o that, major manufacturers haes annoonced that thay will increasinly produce smairt TVs in the mid-2010s. Smairt tellies wi integrate Internet an Web 2.0 functions becam the dominant telly furm bi the late 2010s.
Telly seegnals wis ineetially distreebute anly as terrestrial telly uisin heich-pouered radio-frequency transmitters tae braidcast the seegnal tae individual telly receivers. Alternatively, telly seegnals is distreebute bi coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite seestems an, syne the 2000s via the Internet. Till the early 2000s, thir war transmittit as analog seegnals, but a transeetion tae deegital telly is expectit tae be complete warldwide bi the late 2010s. A staundart telly set is componed o multiple internal electronic circuits, includin a tuner for receivin an decodin braidcast seegnals. A veesual display device that lacks a tuner is correctly cried a video monitor raither nor a telly.
