There are two versions of the history of Oil noodles. The first version is that the oil noodle was seen in the market in the late Ming Dynasty. Then it was selected as court food in the Qing Dynasty, so they are called "Longxu tribute noodles". "Longxu" means "the beard of the dragon", and the dragon is a symbol of the Chinese emperor.
The second version is that a long time ago, a farmer's family walked and died to avoid the war. Only the grandfather and grandson remained dependent on each other. Due to years of drought and wars, crops have not been harvested. In order to survive the famine, Grandpa went hunting in the mountains every day. In a cold winter, Grandpa went out for half a day to hunt back a fat wild goat. Both grandma and grandpa enjoyed it until after the Spring Festival. Due to the heat, most of the leftover mutton could not be eaten. For storage, Grandpa thought of a way to cut the remaining mutton into chunks and store it after the oil exploded. When cooking, each time the oiled mutton and dried vegetables were fried into a dish, and it was mixed with potato noodles, corn noodles, and wheat noodles. The noodles made not only solved the food for the two people to survive the famine, but also made the little grandson shouted after eating. Later, the little grandson started a business and never forgets his grandfather's noodles with oil and meat. In order to commemorate his late grandfather, he opened a restaurant called "Fried Pork Noodles" in Qitai Lihuajian. When the guests ate, they all praised it. From then on, "Gao You Po Noodles" became famous, and it continues to this day.
