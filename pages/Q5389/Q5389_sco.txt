== Host naitions an ceeties ==

The host ceety for an Olympic Gemmes is uisually chuisen seiven tae aicht year aheid o thair celebration. The process o selection is cairried oot in twa phases that span a twa-year period. The prospective host ceety applies tae its kintra's Naitional Olympic Committee; gif mair nor ane ceety frae the same kintra submits a proposal tae its NOC, the naitional committee teepically hauds an internal selection, syne anly ane ceety per NOC can be presentit tae the Internaitional Olympic Committee for consideration. Ance the deadline for submission o proposals bi the NOCs is reakit, the first phase (Application) begins wi the applicant ceeties asked tae complete a questionnaire regardin several key criteria relatit tae the organisation o the Olympic Gemmes. In this form, the applicants maun gie assurances that thay will comply wi the Olympic Charter an wi ony ither regulations established bi the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation o the filled questionnaires bi a specialised group provides the IOC wi an owerview o each applicant's project an thair potential tae host the Gemmes. On the basis o this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Buird selects the applicants that will proceed tae the candidature stage.
Ance the candidate ceeties are selectit, thay maun submit tae the IOC a bigger an mair detailed presentation o thair project as pairt o a candidature file. Ilka ceety is thoroughly analyzed bi an evaluation commission. This commission will veesit the candidate ceeties an aw, interviewin local offeecials an inspecting prospective venue steids, an submit a report on its findins ane month prior tae the IOC's final decision. Durin the interview process the candidate ceety maun an aa guarantee that it will be able tae fund the Gemmes. Efter the wirk o the evaluation commission, a leet o candidates is presentit tae the General Session o the IOC, whilk maun assemble in a kintra that disnae hae a candidate ceety in the runnin. The IOC memmers gathered in the Session hae the final vote on the host ceety.
