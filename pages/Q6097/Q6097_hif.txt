Tea can also be used as another word for an afternoon meal (mostly in the Commonwealth countries), as in "I am having tea in a short while."  The word also applies to "afternoon tea", a small snack meal served sometimes, usually featuring sandwiches, cakes and tea.  This small snack meal is also called "tea time".
