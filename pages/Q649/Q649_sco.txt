At the centre o the ceety, in Central Admeenistrative Okrug, is the Moscow Kremlin, which hooses the hame o the Preses o Roushie as well as mony o the facilities for the naitional govrenment.

Moscow, lik wi ony naitional caipital, is an aw the host o aw the foreign embassies an diplomats representin a multitude o naitions in Roushie.

Amang the 83 federal subjects o Roushie, Moscow represents the maist populatit ane an the smawest ane in terms o area. Lastly, Moscow is locatit athin the central economic region, ane o twal regions athin Russia wi seemilar economic goals.


=== Admeenistrative diveesions ===

The entire ceety o Moscow is heidit bi ane mayor (Sergey Sobyanin). The ceety o Moscow is dividit intae 12 admeenistrative okrugs an 146 destricts.
The Roushie caipital's specific toun-plannin development began tae shaw as early as the 12t century, when the ceety wis foondit. The central pairt o Moscow grew bi consolidatin wi suburbs in line wi the medieval principles o urban development, when strang fortress waws wad gradually gird alang the circle streets o adjacent new settlements. The first circular defence waws set the trajectory o Moscow's rings, layin the grundwirk for futur toun-plannin o the Roushie caipital.
The follaein fortifications servit as the ceety's circular defence bundaries at some pynt in history: the Kremlin waws, Zemlyanoy Gorod (earthwirk toun), the Kamer-Kollezhsky Rampart, the Garden Ring, an the smaw railwey ring. The Moscow Automobile Ring Road (MKAD) haes been Moscow's bundary syne 1960. An aw in the form o a circle are the main Moscow subway line, the Ring Line, an the sae-cried Third Automobile Ring, which wis completit in 2005. Hence, the characteristic radial-circle plannin continues tae define Moscow's further development. Housomeivver, contemporary Moscow haes an aw engulft a nummer o territories ootside the MKAD, sic as Solntsevo, Butovo, an the toun o Zelenograd.
Aw admeenistrative okrugs an destricts hae thair awn coats o airms an flags as well as the heid offeecials.
In addition tae the destricts, thare are Territorial Units wi Special Status. This uisually include areas wi sma or nae permanent populations, sic as the case wi the All-Russia Exhibition Center, the Botanical Garden, lairge pairks, an industrial zones. In recent years, some territories hae been mergit wi different destricts. Thare are nae ethnic-specific regions in Moscow, as in the Cheenatouns that exist in some North American an East Asie ceeties. Awtho destricts are no designated bi income, as wi maist ceeties, those areas that are closer tae the city centre, metro stations or green zones are considered mair prestigious.
Moscow an aw hosts some o the govrenment bodies o Moscow Oblast, awtho the city itsel is admeenistratively separate frae the oblast.
