The aiple tree (Malus pumila, commonly an erroneously cried Malus domestica) is a deciduous tree in the rose faimily best kent for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the aiple. It is cultivatit warldwide as a fruit tree, an is the maist widely growed species in the genus Malus. The tree originatit in Central Asie, whaur its wild auncestor, Malus sieversii, is still foond the day. Aiples hae been growed for thoosands o years in Asie an Europe, an war brocht tae North Americae bi European colonists. Aiples hae releegious an meethological signeeficance in mony culturs, includin Norse, Greek an European Christian tradeetions.
Aiple trees are lairge if growed frae seed. Generally aiple cultivars are propagatit bi graftin ontae ruitstocks, which control the size o the resultin tree. Thare are mair nor 7,500 kent cultivars o aiples, resultin in a range o desired chairactereestics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes an uises, includin cuikin, eatin raw an cider production. Trees an fruit are prone tae a nummer o fungal, bacterial an pest problems, which can be controlled bi a nummer o organic an non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome wis sequenced as pairt o resairch on disease control an selective breedin in aiple production.
Warldwide production o aiples in 2014 wis 84.6 million tonnes, wi Cheenae accoontin for 48% o the tot.
