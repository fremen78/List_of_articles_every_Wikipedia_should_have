Nanoteknologi adolah manipulasi materi pado skala atomik dan skala molekular nan ado satalah zaman digital. Diameter atom bakisar antaro 62 pikometer (atom Helium) hinggo 520 pikometer (atom Cesium), sadangkan kombinasi dari babarapo atom mambantuak molekul jo kisaran ukuran nano, iyolah ukuran bando nan godangnyo: ciek par miliar meter (0,0000000001 m) atau sameter dibagi ciek miliar. Istilah Nanoteknologi partamo kali disabuik dalam pidato ilmiah Profesor Nario Taniguci taun 1974.
Deskripsinyo bamulo dari nanoteknologi nan mangacu pado tujuan panggunoan teknologi untuak mamanipulasi atom dan molekul untuak mambuek produk baskala makro. Deskripsi nan labiah umum iyolah manipulasi materi jo ukuran maksimum 100 nanometer.
