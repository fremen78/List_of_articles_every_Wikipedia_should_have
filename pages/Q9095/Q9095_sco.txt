James Clerk Maxwell (13 Juin 1831 – 5 November 1879) wis a Scots physicist, born in Edinburgh. Maxwell developit a set o equations expressin the basic laws o eletric an magnetism as weel as the Maxwell distribution in the kinetic theory o gases. 

He wis the last member o a cadet brainch o the weel-kent Scots faimlie o Clerk o Penicuik. He wis eddicatit at Edinburgh Academy than the Varsity o Edinburgh, and Cambridge. He taucht at Marischal College, Aiberdeen and Keeng's College, London, and the Varsity o Cambridge. He wis eleckit tae the Ryal Society in 1866, but wisnae gien ony Scots awards or honours whan alive. He dee'd on 5 November 1879, and is buirit at Parton, Kirkcudbrightshire. 
Maxwell is aften thocht on as the scientist o the 1800s that haed the maist influence on the physics o the 1900s, makkin contreibutions tae the basic models o naitur. In 1931, on the centennial anniversar o Maxwell's birth, Einstein descrieved Maxwell's wark as the "maist profound an the maist fruitfu that physics haes experienced syne the time o Newton."
Algebraic mathematics wi elements o geometry is a featur o a hantle o Maxwell's wark. Maxwell shawed that eletric an magnetic forces is twa complementar aspecks o eletromagnetism. He shawed that eletric an magnetic fields traivels throu space, in the form o waves, at a steady velocity o 3.0 × 108 m/s. He proponed forby that licht wis a form o eletromagnetic radiation.
The scienteific compound derived CGS unit meisurin magnetic flux (aften shortent til f), the maxwell (Mx), is named in his honour. A reenge o muntains on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is named efter him, as weel as the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the mucklest sub-mm astronomical prospect in the warld, wi a diameter o 15 metres, whit wis 30 year auld in 2017.

A  science biggin at the Varsity o Edinburgh is named efter him, kent as the JCMB biggin. In 2007 a new science biggin at Edinburgh Academy wis named efter him an haed his equations carvit intae the lobby waw. In 2008, a fou-size statue o him wis pitten up in George Street, Edinburgh.
