Immanuel Kant (German: [ɪˈmaːnu̯eːl kant]; 22 Aprile 1724 – 12 Februar 1804) wis a German filosopher that  is widely conseedert tae be a central feegur o modren filosofie. In his doctrine o transcendental idealism, he argied that space, time, an causation are mere sensibilities; "things-in-themsels" exist, but thair naitur is unkenable. In his view, the mind shapes an structures experience, wi aw human experience sharin certain structural featurs. He drew a parallel tae the Copernican revolution in his proposition that warldly objects can be intuitit a priori ('aforehaund'), an that intueetion is tharefore independent frae objective reality. Kant believed that raison is the soorce o morality, an that aesthetics arise frae a faculty o disinterestit juidgment. Kant's views conteena tae hae a major influence on contemporary filosofie, especially the fields o epistemology, ethics, poleetical theory, an post-modren aesthetics.
In ane o Kant's major warks, the Critique o Pure Raison (1781), he attemptit tae explain the relationship atween raison an human experience an tae muive ayont the failyies o tradeetional filosofie an metapheesics. Kant wantit tae pit an end tae an era o futile an speculative theories o human experience, while resistin the skepticism o thinkers sic as David Hume. Kant regairdit himsel as shawin the way past the impasse atween raitionalists an empiricists that filosofie haed led tae, an is widely held tae hae synthesized baith tradeetions in his thocht.
Kant wis an exponent o the idea that perpetual peace coud be siccart throu universal democracy an internaitional cooperation. He believed that this wad be the eventual ootcome o universal history, awtho it is nae raitionally planned. The naitur o Kant's releegious ideas conteenas tae be the subject o filosofical dispute, wi viewpynts rangin frae the impression that he wis an ineetial advocate o atheism that at some pynt developed an ontological argument for God, tae mair creetical treatments epitomised bi Nietzsche, that claimed that Kant haed "theologian bluid" an wis merely a sophisticatit apologist for tradeetional Christian faith.
Kant published ither important warks on ethics, releegion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, an history. Thir include the Universal Natural History (1755), the Critique o Practical Raison (1788), the Metapheesics o Morals (1797), an the Critique o Juidgment (1790), that leuks at aesthetics an teleology.
