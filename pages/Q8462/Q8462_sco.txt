Timur (frae the Perso-Arabic form تیمور‎ Tīmūr, ultimately frae Chagatai (Middle Turkic) Temür "iron"; 8 Aprile 1336 – 18 Februar 1405), normally kent as Tamerlane (frae Tīmūr-e Lang) in Inglis, wis a fowerteent-century conqueror o Wastren, South an Central Asie, foonder o the Timurid Empire an Timurid dynasty (1370–1405) in Central Asie, an great great grandfaither o Babur, the foonder o the Mughal Dynasty, whilk survived till 1857 as the Mughal Empire in Indie.
Born intae the Turco-Mongol Barlas tribe wha ruled in Central Asie, Timur wis in his lifetime a controversial figure, an remains the lik the day. He socht tae restore the Mongol Empire, yet his heaviest blow wis again the Islamized Tatar Golden Horde. He wis mair at hame in an urban environment than on the steppe. He styled hissel a ghazi yet some Muslim states, e.g. the Ottoman Empire, wis severely affectit bi his wars. A great patron o the airts, his campaigns caused vast malafousterin an aw. Timur telt the qadis  o Aleppo, in the sack o that newly conquered ceety,"A amna a man o bluid; an God is mi witness that in aw ma wars A hae niver been the aggressor, an that ma enemies hae aye been the authors o their ain calamity."


== Name ==
Temür means "iron" in the Chagatai leid an accordin tae the Jurnal o the Royal Asiatic Society o Great Breetain & Ireland (1972) the term temür is likely derived frae a Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit wird *čimara ("iron"). As an adult he wis better kent as Timūr Gurkānī (تيمور گوركانى), Gurkān bein the Persianized form o the oreeginal Mongolian wird kürügän, "son-in-law". Ane o Timur's ancestors wha wis kent bi the name "kara-sharnoban" embraced Islam an mairried the dochter o Chagatai Khan (son o Genghis Khan). Timur wis sicweys referred tae as the son-in-law o Chagatai Khan. Various Persian soorces uise a biname, Tīmūr-e Lang (تیمور لنگ) whilk translates tae "Timur the Lame", as he wis lame efter sustainin an injury tae his fit in battle. In his lifetime, his enemies tauntit him wi this name, tae Timur's discomfort. In the Wast, he is commonly kent as Tamerlane, whilk derives frae his Persian biname.


== Personal life ==
Timur wis born in Transoxiana, in the Ceety o Kesh (an aurie nou better kent as Shahrisabz, 'the green ceety,'), some 50 mile sooth o Samarkand in modren Uzbekistan. His faither, Taraqai, wis a sma-scale landawner an belanged the Barlas tribe. The Barlas wur remnants o the oreeginal Mongol hordes o Genghis Khan, who haed bi then embraced Turkic an Persian leids an customs.
Timur wis a Muslim, but while his offeecial releegious counselor wis the Hanafite scholar 'Abdu 'l-Jabbar Khwarazmi, his parteecular persuasion is no kent. In Tirmidh, he haed come unner the influence o his spiritual mentor Sayyid Barakah, a Shiite leader frae Balkh wha is buried alangside Timur in Gur-e Amir. In maugre o his Hanafi background, Timur wis kent tae haud ‘Ali an the Shi’i Imams in hie regaird an haes been notit bi various scholars for his "pro-‘Alid" stance. In maugre o this, Timur wis notit for attackin Shi’is on Sunni grunds an syne his ain releegious inclinations remain unclear.
