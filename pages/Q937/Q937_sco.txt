Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/; German: [ˈalbɛɐ̯t ˈaɪnʃtaɪn] ( listen); 14 Mairch 1879 – 18 Apryle 1955) wis a German-born theoretical physicist. He developpit the theory o relativity, ane o the twa pillars o modren physics (alangside quantum mechanics). Einstein's work is forby kent for its influence on the filosofie o science. Einstein is best kent in popular cultur for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2 (which haes been dubbed "the warld's maist famous equation"). He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services tae theoretical physics, an especially for his diskivery o the law o  the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the evolution o quantum theory.
Near the beginnin o his career, Einstein thocht that Newtonian mechanics wisna eneuch ony mair fur tae reconcile the laws o clessical mechanics wi the laws o the electromagnetic field. This led him tae develop his special theory o relativity throu his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, Swisserland. Briefly afore, he aquired the Swiss ceetizenship in 1901, whilk he kept for his hale life, efter bein stateless for mair nor five year. He realised, housomever, that the principle o relativity coud forby be extendit tae gravitational fields, an wi his subsequent theory o gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on general relativity. He continued tae deal wi problems o stateestical mechanics an quantum theory, whilk led tae his explanations o pairticle theory an the motion o molecules. He forby investigatit the thermal properties o licht whilk laid the foondation o the photon theory o licht. In 1917, Einstein applee'd the general theory o relativity tae model the lairge-scale structur o the universe.
He wis veesitin the Unitit States whan Adolf Hitler came tae pouer in 1933 an, bein Jewish, didnae gae back tae Germany, whaur he haed been a professor at the Berlin Academy o Sciences. He sattlet in the Unitit States, becomin an American ceetizen in 1940. On the een o Warld War II, he endorsed a letter tae Preses Franklin D. Roosevelt alertin him tae the potential development o "extremely pouerful bombs o a new teep" an recommendin that the U.S. begin seemilar resairch. This eventually led tae whit wad become the Manhattan Project. Einstein supportit defendin the Allied forces, but generally denoonced the idea o uisin the newlins diskivert nuclear fission as a wappen. Later, wi the Breetish filosofer Bertrand Russell, Einstein signed the Russell–Einstein Manifesto, whilk heichlichtit the danger o nuclear wappens. Einstein wis affiliatit wi the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, till his daith in 1955.
Einstein published mair nor 300 scienteefic papers alang wi ower 150 non-scienteefic warks. On 5 December 2014, varsities an archives annoonced the release o Einstein's papers, comprisin mair nor 30,000 unique documents. Einstein's intellectual achievements an oreeginality haes made the wird "Einstein" synonymous wi "genius".
