Terrorism is the seestematic uise o terror, aften violent, especially as a means o coercion. In the internaitional commonty, housomeivver, terrorism haes nae legally bindin, creeminal law definition. Common definitions o terrorism refer anerlie tae those violent acts which are intendit tae create fear (terror); are perpetratit for a releegious, poleetical or, ideological goal; an deliberately target or disregard the safety o nan-combatants (civilians). Some definitions nou include acts o unlawful violence an war. The uise o similar tactics bi creeminal organisations for protection rackets or tae enforce a code o silence is uisually no labeled terrorism, tho these same actions mey be labeled terrorism whan done bi a poleetically motivatit group. The writer Heinrich BÃ¶ll an scholars Raj Desai an Harry Eckstein hae suggestit that attempts tae protect against terrorism mey lead tae a kynd o social oppression.
