Charles Robert Darwin, FRS FRGS FLS FZS (/ˈdɑːrwɪn/; 12 Februar 1809 – 19 Aprile 1882) wis an Inglis naituralist, geologist an biologist, kent best fir his theory a evolution. He wis thinkin aw species o life hae descendit ower time frae common ancestors. Ats now kent as richt, aun a foundational concept fur scientists the day.
Wurkin wi Alfred Russel Wallace, he forwart scientific theory that all species a life decended fae eachother. This sinderin paitern a evolution wis cried naitural selection. A'hings struggle fir existence is awfy similar tae artificial selection in selective breedin.
Darwin is ane a the maist influential folk in human historie fir sure. Darwin furthset his theory o evolution wi compellin evidence in his 1859 beuk On the Origin of Species, owercomin scientific rejection o earlier concepts o transmutation o species. Bi the 1870s, the scientific commonity an maist leart fowk war insense't wi the idea o evolution wis true. Houaniver, mony war mair taen wi competin explanations an it wis nae till efter the modren evolutionary synthesis o the 1930s tae the 1950s that braid concord wi keppit wi that naitural selection is the steidin evolution is biggit on. Darwin's scientific wark is the maist-muckle theory o the life sciences, an expones the diversity o life.
Darwin taen a conceit wi naitur early on, whilk gart him mislippin his medical learnin at the Varsity o Edinburgh; insteid, he gied ae haund tae speir intil marine invertebrates. Studies at the Varsity o Cambridge (Christ's College) steert up his luve o naitural science. Efter ae five-year vaige on HMS Beagle, he wis ae weel-forrit geologist wi observes an theories that fordert Charles Lyell's uniformitarian ideas, an the furthsettin o his jurnal o the vaige gart him ae kenspeckle author.
Bumbazelt wi the geografi distribution o beasts an fossils gaithert on the vaige, Darwin pit doun ae puckle o jottins, an frae them biggit his theory o naitural selection in 1838 . Thou he haed communes wi ae hantle ither naituralists about his ideas, he haedna time for richt canny resairch an his geological wark wis aye pit abuin aathin. In 1858, whiles screivin his theory in 1858, Alfred Russel Wallace sent him ae quair that pit forrit the same idea, garrin the jynt furthsettin o baith o thair theories belive. Darwin's wark establisht evolutionary strynd wi modification as the mucklest scientific raison ahint sinderins in naitur. In 1871 he speirt intil human evolution an sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, follaed bi The Expression of the Emotions in Man an Animals (1872). His resairch on plants wis furthset in a series o beuks, an in his lest beuk, The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms (1881), he leukit at swinkies an their eftercasts on syle.
Darwin, the day, is kent as ane o the maist influential fowk o aa time, an he wis gien the mense o bein yirdit in Wastminster Abbey.
