雪降落的過程被稱為下雪或降雪。雲中溫度低於0℃的許多小雲滴在冰晶上互相碰撞凝結形成雪珠，小雪珠是由許多細白的冰粒聚集而成的。當冷空氣逐漸向前推移，上升氣流減弱，雲中水氣直接在冰晶上凝結成較大的形態，此即我們所見到的雪花。如果溫度接近冰點，則會落下溼雪，形成較大的雪花，特別是無風的時候。大型的星形雪花直徑可達5到7公分。多數的雪花在落下地面的途中會融化成雨，只有當接近地面的空氣夠冷，才能讓雪花落到地面成雪。
Snow refers to forms of ice crystals that precipitate from the atmosphere (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.
