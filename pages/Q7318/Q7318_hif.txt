Hitler continued on and took over France in the Battle of France. Afterwards, on October 12, 1939, Hitler sent a letter to the United Kingdom demanding they surrender and that if they do surrender, the Germans won't do anything bad to them. However, Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister at the time refused and the Battle of Britain began.
The Battle of Britain lasted throughout July to October 1940. The battle resulted in heavy losses for the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), and in early October they retreated back into Greater Germany. Hitler was unhappy and furious with the failure of the Battle and demanded that Britain be taken over one way or another. 
In 1941, Hitler gave orders to attack the Soviet Union. The first attack was codenamed "Operation Barbarossa" and went from June 22, 1941 into winter that year. Russian winter is very harsh and many soldiers got sick from the cold weather. Hitler lost 250,000 men, over 2,000 aircraft and over 2,500 tanks until December 5, 1941 when Hitler's soldiers couldn't last longer there and were pushed back by the Russian defenders. Hitler, although a good strategist, had not thought this plan through and ended up losing over 20% of his army of 3.9 million.
After that, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union teamed up and fought Hitler's army. On April 30, 1945 Hitler killed himself and on 8, May 1945 the war was over. Nazi Germany was taken over by the four allied nations.
