Shia Islam (Arabic: شيعة‎, Shīʿah) is the seicont lairgest denomination o Islam, efter Sunni Islam. The follaers o Shia Islam are cried Shi'ites or Shias. "Shia" is the short form o the historic phrase Shīʻatu ʻAlī (شيعة علي), meanin "follaers o Ali", "faction o Ali", or "pairty o Ali".
Like ither schuils o thocht in Islam, Shia Islam is based on the teachins o the Islamic holy beuk, the Quran an the message o the final prophet o Islam, Muhammad. In contrast tae ither schuils o thocht, Shias believe that anerlie the Almichty haes the richt tae chuise a representative tae safeguard Islam, Qurʻān an Shariah (based upon verses in the Quran which stipulate this accordin tae Shias). Shias believe that these Quranic verses mak it clear that anerlie Allah chuises a viceregent on Earth, therefore nae ane else haes a choice in the matter. This means that God's representatives like Prophets an Imāms canna be electit bi common Muslims, which is why Shias disawn the election an selection o Abu Bakr, Umar an Uthman ibn Affan bi the fowk, to represent Islam an the Qurʻān. Thus Shias dae no consider Ali tae be the fowert Caliph, rather the first "Imam". Shias believe that there are numerous narrations whaur the prophet selectit Ali as his successor.
