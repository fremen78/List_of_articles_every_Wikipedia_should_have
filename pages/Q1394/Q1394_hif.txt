Lenin also talked about the mistakes of many members of the Bolshevik Central Committee (including Zinoviev, Kamenev and Stalin) who helped the government to continue to fight the war against Germany, against the wishes of the Leninists. 
During July 1917, when people said that Lenin had got money from the Germans; he was afraid and had to flee to Finland.
In October 1917, the Bolsheviks under Lenin and Trotsky headed the Petrograd Soviet and other Soviets all over Russia in a taking of power from Kerensky's Government, known as the October Revolution ended up in the making of the first Marxist Communist State in world history.
On November 8, 1917, Lenin was chosen Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars by the Russian Soviet Congress. This means that he was the leader of Russia. 
Because he was shocked by the German invasion, he signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Russia lost a lot of land, but the Germans stopped the invasion.
During the Russian Civil War, Lenin started war communism. But after the war, Lenin brought the New Economic Policy. Some private enterprise was allowed, but not much at all. Businessmen, known as nepmen, can own only light industry, not heavy.

After Fanny Kaplan (opposition party august 30 1918) shot Lenin, he started having many strokes and never recovered. By May 1922, he was badly paralysed. After a stroke in March 1923, he could not speak or move. Lenin's fourth stroke killed him in January 1924. Just before the stroke Lenin wanted to get rid of Stalin, considering him dangerous to the soviet republic.
The city of St. Petersburg had been renamed by the Tsar to Petrograd in 1914, but was renamed Leningrad in Lenin's honour in 1924. But after the end of soviet socialism, in 1991, it was called St. Petersburg again. 
Before Lenin died, he said he wished to be buried beside his mother.  When he died, the communists led by dictator stalin let the people of Russia come to look at him.  Because people kept coming, they decided not to bury him.  A building was built, in Red Square, Moscow, over Lenin's body, so that people could see him. Lenin's body was mummified (became mummy). It is called the Lenin mausoleum (a mausoleum is a building for dead people). It is a situated in Moscow, Russia, and many people still go there to see him. The body looks ok but it has deteriorated, years of preservation brought tissue wear.
The Russian orthodox churchs prefers burying him with his family, proposal was give to the government but no official reply has been received because his viewing brings in revenue to the russian government.
