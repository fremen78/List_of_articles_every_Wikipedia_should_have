The euro is dividit intae 100 cents (whiles cried eurocent, especially whan sinderin it frae the U.S. cent or the umwhile currency in a parteecular kintra). Aw circulatin euro cunyies (includin the €2 commemorative cunyies) haes a common side shawin the denomination (vailie) wi the auld 19 EU-kintras in the backgrund. Frae 2007 or 2008 on (lippenin on the kintra whaur the cunyie is issued) that "auld" cairt is replaced bi a cairt o Europe, that nou shows nane-EU-members sic as Norrowey. The cunyies haes a naitional side shawin an eemage speceefically waled bi the kintra that issued the cunyie. Euro cunyies frae ony kintra can be freely uised in ony naition that haes adoptit the euro.
The euro cunyies are €2, €1, €0.50, €0.20, €0.10, €0.05, €0.02, an €0.01. In the Netherlands cash transactions is roondit tae the nearest five cents, tae avoid the uise o €0.02, an €0.01, an in Finland, the twa smawest denominations isna ony langer struck, tho thay remain legal tender thare. (See Linguistic issues concernin the euro an aw.)
Commemorative cunyies wi €2 face value hae been issued wi chynges tae the design o the naitional side o the cunyie — as Greece did for the 2004 Summer Olympics. Thir twa-euro cunyies is legal tender throughoot the Eurozone. Cunyies wi various ither denominations hae been issued an aw, but thir are no intendit for general circulation. Thir later cunyies are anly legal tender in the naition that issued them.
Aw euro banknotes hae a common design for each denomination on baith sides. Notes are issued in €500, €200, €100, €50, €20, €10, €5. The design for each o them haes a common theme o European airchitecture in various airtistic periods. The front (or recto) o the note features windaes or gateways while the back (or verso) haes brigs. Care haes been taen sae that the airchitectural examples dinna represent ony actual existin monument, sae as no tae induce jealousy an controversy in the choice o whilk monument should be depictit. Some o the hiechest denominations sic as the €500 are no issued in a few kintras, tho thay remain legal tender athort the Eurozone.
