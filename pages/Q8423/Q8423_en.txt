Cyrus (Persian: ⁄©Ÿàÿ±Ÿàÿ¥) is a male given name and the name of several Persian kings, particularly Cyrus the Great (c.‚Äâ600‚Äì530 BC), but also Cyrus I of Anshan (c.‚Äâ650 BC), King of Persia and the grandfather of Cyrus the Great, and Cyrus the Younger (died 401 BC), brother to the Persian king Artaxerxes II of Persia.


== Etymology ==
Cyrus, as a word in English, is the Latinized form of the Greek Œö·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ, K»≥ros, from Old Persian êé§êé¢êéΩêé¢êèÅ K≈´ru≈°. According to the inscriptions, the name is reflected in Elamite Kura≈°, Babylonian Ku(r)-ra≈°/-ra-√°≈° and Imperial Aramaic kwr≈°. The modern Persian form of the name is K≈´ro≈°.
The etymology of Cyrus has been and continues to be a topic of discussion amongst historians, linguists, and scholars of Iranology. The Old Persian name "kuru≈°" has been interpreted in various forms such as "the Sun", "like Sun", "young", "hero," and "humiliator of the enemy in verbal contest" and the Elamite "kura≈°" has been translated as one "who bestows care".
The name has appeared on many monuments and inscriptions in Old Persian. There is also the record of a small inscription in Morghab (southwestern Iran) on which there is the sentence (adam k≈´ru≈° x≈°ƒÅyaŒ∏iya haxƒÅmani≈°iya) in Old Persian meaning (I am Cyrus the Achaemenian King). After a questionable proposal by the German linguist F. H. Weissbach that Darius the Great was the first to inscribe in Persian, it had previously been concluded by some scholars that the inscription in Morghab refers to Cyrus the Younger. This proposal resulted from a false interpretation of a passage in paragraph 70 of the Behistun inscription by Darius the Great. Based on many arguments, the accepted theory among modern scholars is that the inscription does belong to Cyrus the Great.
There are interpretations of the name of Cyrus by classical authors identifying with or referring to the Persian word for "Sun". The Historian Plutarch (46‚Äì120) states that "the sun, which, in the Persian language, is called  Cyrus". Also, the Physician Ctesias who served in the court of the Persian king Artaxerxes II of Persia writes in his book Persica as summarized by Photios that the name Cyrus is from the Persian word "Khur" (the sun). These are, however, not accepted by modern scholars.
Regarding the etymology of Old Persian kuru≈°, linguists have proposed various etymologies based on Iranian languages as well as non-Indo-European ones. According to Tavernier, the name kura≈°, attested in Elamite texts, is likely "the original form" as there is no Elamite or Babylonian spelling ku-ru-u≈° in the transcriptions of Old Persian ku-u-r(u)-u-≈°. That is, according to Tavernier, kura≈° is an Elamite name and means "to bestow care". Others, such as Schmitt, Hoffmann maintain that the Persian Kuru≈°, which according to Skalmowsky, may be connected to (or borrowing from) the IE K√∫ru- from Old Indic can give an etymology of the Elamite kura≈°. In this regard, the Old Persian kuru≈° is considered with the following etymologies: One proposal is discussed by the linguist Janos Harmatta that refers to the common Iranian root "kur-" (be born) of many words in Old, middle, and new Iranian languages (e.g. Kurdish). Accordingly, the name K≈´ru≈° means "young, youth...". Other Iranian etymologies have been proposed. The Indian proposal of Skalmowsky goes down to "to do, accomplish". Another theory is the suggestion of Karl Hoffmann that kuru≈° goes down to a -ru derivation from the IE root *(s)kau meaning "to humiliate"  and accordingly "kuru≈°" (hence "Cyrus") means "humiliator (of the enemy in verbal contest)".
