The term "mainlaund China" is whiles uised tae denote the aurie unner FRC owerins, but for normal excludin the twa Speicial Administrative Regions, Hong Kong an Macau.

Name
The wird "China" his been yaised in Englis since the 16th centurie; hooever, it wasnae a wird used by the Cheenese theresels at this time. Hits origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit wird Cīna, used in ancient India.
"China" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 owersett o the 1516 journal o the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. Barbosa's yaisage wis derivit fae Persian Chīn (چین), which wis in turn derivit from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन). Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahābhārata (5th century bce) and the Laws o Manu (2nd century bce). In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the wird China is derivit ultimately fae the name o the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). Although this derivation is still gien in various sources, the origin o the Sanskrit wird is a matter of debate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.
The official name o the modern state is the "Fowksrepublic o Cheenae" (simplified Chinese: 中华人民共和国; traditional Chinese: 中華人民共和國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó). The shorter form is "Cheenae" Zhōngguó (中国; 中國) fae 'zhōng' ("central") and 'guó' ("state"), a term which developed durin the Western Zhou dynasty in reference tae its royal demesne. It was then applied tae the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain afore being yaised as an occasional synonym fir the state under the Qing. It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia fowk fae perceived "barbarians". The name Zhongguo is also translated as "Middle Kingdom" in English.
