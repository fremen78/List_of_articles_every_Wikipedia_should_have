=== Usage ===
Amongst people in some English-speaking countries, there is sometimes a tendency to confuse the linguistic and geographic divisions of the Americas: thus, Mexico, some Central American and Caribbean territories are mistakingly included in South America.  The term Latin America is correctly used when referring to those territories whose official or national languages come from Latin (French, Portuguese, and Spanish).  Conversely, Anglo-America is used to refer to areas whose major languages are Germanic (English or Dutch) such as Guyana, Suriname, Belize, Jamaica, and much of the West Indies.  Similarly, areas where English is prominent are considered part of the Anglosphere.
