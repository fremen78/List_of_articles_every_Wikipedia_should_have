A transformer is a static electrical device that transfers energy bi inductive couplin atween its windin circuits. A varyin current in the primary windin creates a varyin magnetic flux in the transformer's core an thus a varyin magnetic flux through the seicontary windin. This varyin magnetic flux induces a varyin electromotive force (emf) or voltage in the seicontary windin. Transformers can be uised tae vary the relative voltage o circuits or isolate them, or baith.
Transformers range in size frae thumbnail-sized uised in microphones tae units wichin hundrits o tons interconnectin the pouer grid.  A wide range o transformer designs are uised in electronic an electric pouer applications. Transformers are essential for the transmission, distreibution, an utilization o electrical energy.
