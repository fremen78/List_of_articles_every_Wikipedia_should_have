In physics, special relativity (SR, forby kent as the special theory o relativity or STR) is the acceptit physical theory regardin the relationship atween space an time. It is based on twa postulates: (1) that the laws o physics are invariant (i.e., identical) in aw inertial seestems (non-acceleratin frames o reference); an (2) that the speed o licht in a vacuum is the same for aw observers, regairdless o the motion o the licht soorce. It wis oreeginally proponed in 1905 bi Albert Einstein in the paper "On the Electrodynamics o Movin Bodies". The inconsistency o classical mechanics wi Maxwellâ€™s equations o electromagnetism led tae the development o special relativity, which corrects classical mechanics tae haundle situations involvin motions nearin the speed o licht. As o the day, special relativity is the maist accurate model o motion at ony speed. Even sae, classical mechanics is still uisefu (due tae its sheer simplicity an heich accuracy) as an approximation at smaa velocities relative tae the speed o licht, an it requires much less complicatit calculations.
It is pairt of the theory o relativity, an is expandit by the theory o general relativity.
