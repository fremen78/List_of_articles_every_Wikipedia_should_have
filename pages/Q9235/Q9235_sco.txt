Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (German: [ˈɡeɔɐ̯k ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈheːɡəl]; 27 August 1770 – 14 November 1831) wis a German philosopher that wis a major feegur in German idealism. He achieved wide recogneetion in his day an—while primarily influential within the continental tradeetion o philosophie—haes acome increasinly influential in the analytic tradition as well. Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within Western philosophy is universally recognized.
Hegel's principal achievement wis his development o a distinctive airteeculation o idealism, whiles termed absolute idealism, in that the dualisms of, for instance, mynd an naitur an subject an object are owercome. His philosophie o speerit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, airt, releegion an philosophie. His accoont o the master–sclave dialectic haes been heichly influential, especially in 20t-century Fraunce. O special importance is his concept o speerit (Geist, whiles an aw translatit as "mynd") as the historical manifestation o the logical concept an the "sublation" (Aufhebung, integration withoot elimination or reduction) o seeminly contradictory or opposin factors: ensaumples include the apparent opposeetion atween necessity an freedom an atween immanence an transcendence. Hegel haes been seen in the 20t century as the oreeginator o the thesis, antithesis, synthesis triad, but as an expleecit phrase it oreeginatit wi Johann Gottlieb Fichte.
Hegel haes influenced mony thinkers an writers that's awn poseetions vary widely. Karl Barth descrived Hegel as a "Protestant Aquinas" while Maurice Merleau-Ponty wrote that "aw the great philosophical ideas o the past century—the philosophies o Marx an Nietzsche, phenomenology, German existentialism, an psychoanalysis—haed thair beginnins in Hegel."
