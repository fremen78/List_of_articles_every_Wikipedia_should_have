Augustine, a Latin church father, is ane o the maist important feegurs in the development o Wastren Christianity. He "established anew the ancient faith" (conditor antiquae rursum fidei), accordin tae his contemporary, Jerome. In his early years he wis hivily influenced bi Manichaeism an afterwards i the Neo-Platonism o Plotinus, but efter his conversion an baptism (387), he developed his awn approach tae philosophy an theology accommodating a variety o methods an different perspectives. He believed that the grace o Christ wis indispensable tae human freedom an framed the concepts o original sin an just war. When the Roman Empire in the West wis startin tae disintegrate, Augustine developed the concept o the Church as a spiritual City of God (in a book of the same name) distinct frae the material Earthly Ceety. His thocht profoundly influenced the medieval worldview. Augustine's City of God wis closely identified wi the church, an wis the community which worshipped God.
