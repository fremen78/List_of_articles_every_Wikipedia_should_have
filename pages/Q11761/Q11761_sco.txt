=== Britain & Ireland ===
The first metal-wirkin in these islands took place on Ross Island, soothwast Ireland roon aboot 2500 BC. This wis capper rather than bronze, but syne the copper containit airsenic, the metal wis jis as guid as bronze . Yon high airsenic capper may hae inspired an independent invention of alloyin. Bronze is an alloy made up ae tin an capper. Cause tin is so rare geologically, the want fir metal demandit lang distance tradin netwirks . There is a schuil o thocht kenned as the 'Celtic from the West' theory which argues that yon industrial networks may hae spurned the socio-linguistic differentiation of the Proto-Celtic leid fae Proto-Indo-European.
The Brits/Scots Bronze Age lasted fae aroon aboot 2450 BC til aroon 800 BC, fan Airn-wirkin emergit  an the Airn Age commencit. This happened cause capper and tin were in short supply , whereas airn is foond all oer the shop. The collapse ae the Bronze Age saw the collapse ae the elitist trading networks, as local fowk could jist uise their ain local supplies of airn . Indeed, Bronze Age heidbummers may hae deliberately tried tae suppress the new technologie on account of its socioeconomic impacts .
