Meisurement (frae Auld French, mesurement) is the assignment o nummers tae objects or events. It is a cornerstane o maist naitural sciences, technology, economics, an quantitative research in ither social sciences.
Ony meisurement can be judged bi the follaein meta-meisurement criterie values: level o meisurement (which includes magnitude), dimensions (units), an uncertainty. Thay enable comparisons tae be duin atween different meisurements an reduce confusion. Even in cases o clear qualitative similarity or difference, increased preceesion through quantitative meisurement is eften preferred in order tae aid in replication. For example, different colours mey be operationalized grundit either on wavelengths o licht or (qualitative) terms such as "green" an "blue" which are eften interpretit differently bi different fowk. The science o meisurement is cried metrology.
