Nicknamed "The Ceety o a Thoosan Minarets" for its preponderance o Islamic airchitectur, Cairo haes lang been a centre o the region's poleetical an cultural life. Even afore Cairo wis established in the 10t century, the land composin the present-day ceety wis the site o naitional caipitals whose remnants remain visible in pairts o Auld Cairo. Cairo is an aa associatit wi Auncient Egyp due tae its proximity tae the Great Sphinx an the pyramids in adjacent Giza.
Egyptians the day aften refer tae Cairo as Maṣr (Arabic:مصر), the Arabic pronunciation o the name for Egyp itsel, emphasizin the ceety's continued role in Egyptian influence. Cairo haes the auldest an lairgest film an muisic industries in the Arab Warld, as well as the warld's seicont-auldest institution o hichter learnin, al-Azhar University. Mony internaitional media, businesses, an organisations hae regional heidquarters in the ceety, an the Arab League haes haed its heidquarters in Cairo for maist o its existence.


== Geography ==

Cairo is locatit in northren Egyp, kent as Lawer Egyp, 
165 kilometers (100 mi) sooth o the Mediterranean Sea an 120 kilometers (75 mi) wast o the Gulf o Suez an Suez Canal. The ceety is alang the Nile River, immediately sooth o the pynt whaur the river leaves its desert-bund valley an branches intae the law-lyin Nile Delta region. Awtho the Cairo metropolis extends away frae the Nile in aw directions, the ceety o Cairo resides anerlie on the east bank o the river an twa islands athin it on a tot aurie o 453 square kilometers (175 sq mi).

Till the mid-19t century, when the river wis tamed bi dams, levees, an ither controls, the Nile in the vicinity o Cairo wis heichlie susceptible tae chynges in course an surface level. Ower the years, the Nile gradually shiftit wastward, providin the site atween the eastren edge o the river an the Mokattam hielands on which the ceety nou staunds. The land on which Cairo wis established in 969 (present-day Islamic Cairo) wis locatit unnerwater juist ower three hunder years earlier, when Fustat wis first biggit.
Law periods o the Nile durin the 11t century continued tae add tae the landscape o Cairo; a new island, kent as Geziret al-Fil, first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connectit tae the mainland. The day, the site o Geziret al-Fil is occupied bi the Shubra destrict. The law periods creatit anither island at the turn o the 14t century that nou composes Zamalek an Gezira. Land reclamation efforts bi the Mamluks an Ottomans faur contributit tae expansion on the east bank o the river.

Acause o the Nile's movement, the newer pairts o the ceety – Garden Ceety, Cairo Ceety Centre, an Zamalek – are locatit closest tae the riverbank. The auries, which are hame tae maist o Cairo's embassies, are surroondit on the north, east, an sooth bi the aulder pairts o the ceety. Auld Cairo, locatit sooth o the centre, haulds the remnants o Fustat an the hert o Egyp's Coptic Christian community, Coptic Cairo. The Boulaq destrict, which lies in the northren pairt o the ceety, wis born oot o a major 16t-century port an is nou a major industrial centrer. The Citadel is locatit east o the ceety centre aroond Islamic Cairo, which dates back tae the Fatimid era an the foondation o Cairo. While wastren Cairo is dominatit bi wide boulevards, open spaces, an modren architecture o European influence, the eastren hauf, haein grown haphazardly ower the centuries, is dominatit bi sma lanes, croudit tenements, an Islamic architecture.
Northren an extreme eastren pairts o Cairo, which include satellite touns, are amang the maist recent additions tae the ceety, as thay developit in the late-20t an early-21st centuries tae accommodate the ceety's rapid growthe. The wastren bank o the Nile is commonly includit athin the urban aurie o Cairo, but it composes the ceety o Giza an the Giza Govrenorate. Giza haes an aa unnergane significant expansion ower recent years, an the day the ceety, awtho still a suburb o Cairo, haes a population o 2.7 million. The Cairo Govrenorate is juist north o the Helwan Govrenorate, which wis creatit in 2008 when some o Cairo's soothren destricts, includin Maadi an New Cairo, wur split aff an annexed intae the new govrenorate.


== Economy ==
Cairo is an aa in ivery respect the centre o Egyp, as it haes been amaist syne its foondin in 969 AD. The majority o the naition's commerce is generatit thare, or passes throu the ceety. The great majority o publishin hooses an media ootlets an nearly aw film studios are thare, as are hauf o the naition's hospital beds an varsities. This haes fueled rapid construction in the ceety—ane biggin in five is less nor 15 year auld.
This astonishin growthe til recently surged well aheid o ceety services. Hames, roads, electricity, telephone an sewer services wur aw suddent in short supply. Analysts tryin tae grasp the magnitude o the chynge coined terms lik "hyper-urbanization".
