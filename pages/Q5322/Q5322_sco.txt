A capacitor (oreeginally kent as a condenser) is a passive twa-terminal electrical component uised tae store energy electrostatically in an electric field.  The furms o practical capacitors vary widely, but aw contain at least twa electrical conductors separatit bi a dielectric (insulator); for ensaumple, ane common construction consists o metal foils separatit bi a thin layer o insulatin film. Capacitors are widely uised as pairts o electrical circuits in mony common electrical devices.
