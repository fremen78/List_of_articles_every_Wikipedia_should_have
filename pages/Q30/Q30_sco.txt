The Unitit States o Americae (Inglis: United States of America), commonly referred tae as the Unitit States (Inglis: United States, U.S.) or Americae (Inglis: America) or in navajo (Navajo leid Wááshindoon Bikéyah Ałhidadiidzooígíí), is a constitutional federal republic componed o 50 states, a federal destrict, five main sel-govrening territories, an ither possessions.
Forty-aicht o the fifty states an the federal destrict border each ither an locatit in North Americae atween Canadae an Mexico. The state o Alaska is in the northwast neuk o North Americae, bordered bi Canadae tae the east an athort the Bering Strait frae Roushie tae the wast. The state o Hawaii is an airchipelago in the mid-Pacific Ocean. The U.S. territories are scattered aboot the Paceefic Ocean an the Caribbean Sea. Nine time zones are covered. The geografie, climate an wildlife o the kintra are extremely diverse.
At 3.8 million squerr miles (9.8 million km2) an wi ower 324 million fowk, the Unitit States is the warld's fowert-lairgest kintra bi tot aurie (an fowerth-mucklest bi laund aurie) an the third-maist populous. It is ane o the warld's maist ethnically diverse an multicultural naitions, an is hame tae the warld's mucklest nummer o immigrant fowk. Urbanisation climbed tae oweer 80% in 2010 an leads tae growin megaregions. The kintra's caipital is Washington, D.C. an its mucklest ceety is New York Ceety; the ither major metropolitan auries, aw wi aroond five million or mair indwallers, are Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, Philadelphia, Houston, Miami, an Atlanta.
Paleo-Indians migrated frae Asie tae the North American mainland at least 15,000 year ago. European colonisation began in the 16t century. The Unitit States emerged frae 13 Breetish colonies alang the East Coast. Mony disputes atween Great Breetain an the colonies in the eftermath o the Seiven Years' War led tae the American Revolution, whilk began in 1775. On Julie 4, 1776, as the colonies war fichtin Great Breetain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates frae the 13 colonies unanimously adoptit the Declaration o Unthirldom. The war endit in 1783 wi recogneetion o the unthirldom o the Unitit States bi Great Breetain, an wis the first successfu war o unthirldom against a European colonial empire. The current constitution wis adoptit in 1788, efter the Airticles o Confederation, adoptit in 1781, war felt tae hae providit inadequate federal pouers. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill o Richts, war ratified in 1791 an designed tae guarantee mony fundamental ceevil liberties.
The Unitit States gaed on a vigorous expansion athort North Americae throuoot the 19t century, displacin American Indian tribes, acquirin new territories, an gradually admittin new states till it spanned the continent in 1848. During the seicont hauf o the 19t century, the American Ceevil War led tae the end o legal slavery in the kintra. Bi the end o that century, the Unitit States extendit intae the Pacific Ocean, an its economy, driven in muckle pairt bi the Industrial Revolution, began tae growe a lot. The Spaingie–American War an Warld War I confirmed the kintra's status as a global militar pouer. The Unitit States emerged frae Warld War II as a global superpouer, the first kintra tae develop nuclear wappens, the anly kintra tae uise them in warfare, an a permanent member o the Unitit Naitions Security Cooncil. It is a foondin member o the Organisation o American States (OAS) an various ither Pan-American an internaitional organisations. The end o the Cauld War an the end o the Soviet Union in 1991 left the Unitit States as the warld's sole superpouer.
The Unitit States is a heichly developed kintra, wi the warld's mucklest economy bi nominal GDP. It ranks heichly in several meisurs o socioeconomic performance, includin average wage, human development, per capita GDP, an productivity per person. While the U.S. economy is considered post-industrial, chairacterised bi the dominance o services an knawledge economy, the manufacturin sector remains the seicont-mucklest in the warld. Tho its population is anly 4.3% o the warld tot, the Unitit States accoonts for nearly a quarter o warld GDP an ower a third o global militar spendin, makkin it the warld's foremaist economic an militar pouer. The Unitit States is a prominent poleetical an cultural force internaitionally, an a leader in scienteefic resairch an technological innovations.


== History ==
Follaein the European colonisation o the Americaes, aw thirteen o Great Breetain's American colonies spleet frae the mither kintra an formit the Unitit States, the warld's first constitutional an democratic federal republic, efter thair declaration o unthirldom in 1776 an the Weir o Unthirldom (1775–1783). Great Breetain made peace wi the rebols an wi the Treaty o Pairis in 1783. For tae mak a stoot colonol govrenment, the Philadelphia Convention wis foondit in 1787 an raitifeet a constitution in 1788, an the farst Unitit States Senate, Hoose o Representatives, an preses tak office in 1789. George Washington wis the first preses.
Differences o opinion an social order atween northren an soothern states in early Unitit States society, pairteecularly regairdin Black sclavery, ultimately led tae the American Ceevil War. Follaein the Union victory in 1865, three amendments war addit tae the U.S. Constitution: the Thirteent Amendment prohibitit sclavery, the Fowerteent Amendment providit ceetizenship tae the nearly fower million African Americans wha haed been sclaves, an the Fifteent Amendment ensured that thay haed the richt tae vote.
The Unitit States remained neutral frae the ootbreak o Warld War I, in 1914, till 1917 whan it jyned the war as an "associatit pouer", alangside the formal Allies o Warld War I, helpin tae turn the tide against the Central Pouers. In 1920, the weemen's richts muivement wan passage o a constitutional amendment grantin weemen's suffrage. The 1920s an 1930s saw the rise o radio for mass communication an the invention o early televeesion. The prosperity o the Roaring Twenties endit wi the Wall Street Crash o 1929 an the onset o the Great Depression. Efter his election as preses in 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt respondit wi the New Deal, whit included the establishment o the Social Security seestem. At first effectively neutral during Warld War II while Germany conquered much o continental Europe, the Unitit States began supplyin material tae the Allies in Mairch 1941 throu the Lend-Lease programme. On December 7, 1941, the Empire o Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, promptin the Unitit States tae jyn the Allies against the Axis pouers. The Unitit States developed the first nuclear wappens an uised them on Japan in the ceeties o Hiroshima an Nagasaki; causin the Japanese tae surrender on September 2, endin Warld War II.
Efter Warld War II the Unitit States an the Soviet Union jockeyed for pouer during whit acame kent as the Cauld War, driven bi an ideological divide atween caipitalism an communism an, accordin tae the schuil o geopolitics, a divide atween the maritime Atlantic an the continental Eurasian camps. American truips focht communist Cheenese an North Korean forces in the Korean War o 1950–53. The Soviet Union's 1957 launch o the first airtifeecial satellite an its 1961 launch o the first manned spaceflicht ineetiatit a "Space Race" in whit the Unitit States acame the first naition tae laund a man on the muin in 1969. A proxy war in Sootheast Asie eventually evolved intae full American pairteecipation, as the Vietnam War. At hame in the 1960s, the growin Ceevil Richts Muivement uised nonviolence tae confront segregation an discrimination, wi Martin Luther King Jr. acomin a prominent leader an figurheid.
The late 1980s, unner the presidency o Ronald Reagan, brocht a "thowe" in relations wi the USSR, an its collapse in 1991 finally endit the Cauld War.
On September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda terrorists struck the Warld Trade Center in New York Ceety an the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., killin nearly 3,000 fowk. In response, the Unitit States launched the War on Terror, whilk included war in Afghanistan an the 2003–11 Iraq War.
Unner Preses Barack Obama, American forces in Iraq war widrawn in muckle nummers in 2009 an 2010, an the war in the region wis declared formally ower in December 2011. The widrawal caused an escalation o sectarian insurgency, leadin tae the rise o the Islamic State o Iraq an the Levant, the successor o al-Qaeda in the region.


== Geografie, climate, an environs ==
The laund aurie o the contiguous Unitit States is 2,959,064 square mile (7,663,940.6 km2). Alaska, separatit frae the contiguous Unitit States bi Canadae, is the mucklest state at 663,268 square mile (1,717,856.2 km2). Hawaii, occupyin an airchipelago in the central Paceefic, soothwast o North Americae, is 10,931 square mile (28,311 km2) in aurie.
