A plant needs sunlicht, carbon dioxide, minerals an watter for tae mak fuid. A green substance in plants cried chlorophyll traps the energy frae the Sun needed tae mak fuid. Chlorophyll is maistly fund in leafs, athin plastids, that are athin the leaf cells. The leaf can be thocht o as a fuid factory. Leafs o plants vary in shape an size, but thay are aye the plant organ best suited tae fang solar energy. Ance the fuid is made in the leaf, it is transportit tae the ither pairts o the plant sic as stocks an ruits.
