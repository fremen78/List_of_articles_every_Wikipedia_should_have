Eemocks is eusocial beasties o the faimily Formicidae and, alang wi the relatit wasps and bees, belangs the order Hymenoptera. Eemocks evolved frae wasp-like forebeirs in the Cretaceous period, aboot 140 million years syne, and diversified efter the rise o flouerin plants. Mair nor 12,500 o aboot 22,000 speshies haes been clessifee'd. Thay are easy identified by thair elbaed antennae and the distinctive node-like structur that forms thair sclender waists.
Eemocks forms colonies that ranges in size frae a twa-three dizzen predatory individuals leevin in smaw naitural cavities tae gey and organised colonies that micht occupy lairge territories and consist o millions o individuals. Bigger colonies is makkit up o various castes o sterile, weengless females, and maist o thaim is wirkers (ergates), as weel as sodgers (dinergates) and ither specialised groups. Forby, nearhaund aa eemock colonies haes some fertile males cryed "drones" (aner) and ane or mair fertile females cryed "queens" (gynes). The colonies is descrived as superorganisms acause the eemocks appears tae operate as the ae entity, collectively wirkin thegither tae support the colony.
Eemocks haes colonised nearhaund ilka laundmass on Yird. The anely places wantin indigenous eemocks is Antarcticae and a twa-three remote or inhospitable islands. Eemocks thrives in maist ecoseestems and micht mak up 15â€“25% o the terrestrial ainimal biomass. Thair success in a wheen o environments haes been attributit tae thair social organisation and thair abeelity tae chynge habitats, tap resoorces, an defend thairsels. Thair lang co-evolution wi ither species haes led tae meemetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.
Eemock societies haes diveesion o labour, communication atween individuals, and can figgur oot haurd problems. Thir parallels wi human societies haes lang been a inspiration and subject o study. A lot o human culturs maks uiss o eemocks in cuisine, medication, an reetuals. Some species is vailyie'd in thair role as biological pest control augents. Thair abeelity tae exploit resoorces micht bring eemocks intae conflict wi humans, houiver, seein as thay can skaithe craps an invade biggins. Some species, siclike as the reid importit fire eemock (Solenopsis invicta), is regairdit as invasive species, estaiblishin thairsels in airts whaur thay hae been introduced in a mistak.
