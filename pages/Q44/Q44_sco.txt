Beer is an alcoholic drink brewed frae maut, hops an baurley. Beer is the warld's auldest an maist widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third maist popular drink oweraw, efter watter an tea. The production o beer, brewin involves the baurmin o siccars, mainly derived frae cereal grain stairches—maist commonly frae mautit baurley, awtho wheat, maize, an rice are widely uised. Most beer is flavoured wi hops, that add bitterness an act as a naitural preservative, tho ither flavourins sic as yerbs or fruit mey occasionally be includit. The baurmin process causes a naitural carbonation effect, awtho this is eften remuived during processin, an replaced wi forced carbonation. Some o humanity's earliest kent writins refer tae the production an distribution o beer: the Code o Hammurabi includit laws regulatin beer an beer parlours, an "The Hime tae Ninkasi", a prayer tae the Mesopotamian goddess o beer, served as baith a prayer an as a method o rememberin the recipe for beer in a cultur wi few leeterate fowk.
