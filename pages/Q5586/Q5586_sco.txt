Katsushika Hokusai (葛飾 北斎, listen , 31 October 1760 (exact date questionable) – 10 Mey 1849) wis a Japanese airtist, ukiyo-e penter an prentmakker o the Edo period. Born in Edo (nou Tokyo), Hokusai is best kent as author o the widblock prent series Thirty-sax Views o Munt Fuji (富嶽三十六景, Fugaku Sanjūroku-kei, c. 1831) that includes the internaitionally iconic prent, The Great Wave aff Kanagawa.
Hokusai creatit the Thirty-Sax Views baith as a response tae a domestic traivel buim an as pairt o a personal obsession wi Munt Fuji. It wis this series, speceefically The Great Wave prent an Fine Wind, Clear Morn, that siccared Hokusai's fame baith in Japan an owerseas. As historian Richard Lane concludes, "Indeed, if there is one work that made Hokusai's name, both in Japan and abroad, it must be this monumental print-series". While Hokusai's wark prior tae this series is certainly important, it wis nae till this series that he gained braid recogneetion.
