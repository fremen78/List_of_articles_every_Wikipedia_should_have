For common usage, climate change dey describe global warming—de ongoing increase insyd global average temperature den ein effects for de Earth ein Climate system top. Climate change insyd broader sense sanso dey include previous long-term changes to Earth ein climate. De current rise insyd global average temperature be primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since de Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, den some agricultural den industrial practices dey add to greenhouse gases. Dese gases absorb sam of de heat dat de Earth dey radiate after e dey warm from sunlight, dey warm de lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, de primary greenhouse gas dey drive global warming, na e grow by about 50% wey e dey levels unseen for millions of years.
Climate change get increasingly large impact for de environment top. Deserts dey expand, while heat waves den wildfires cam turn more common. Na amplified warming insyd de Arctic contribute to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers den sea ice decline. Higher temperatures sanso dey cause more intense storms, droughts, den oda weather extremes. Rapid environmental change insyd mountains, coral reefs, den de Arctic dey force chaw species make dem relocate anaa cam turn extinct. Even if efforts make dem minimize future warming be successful, sam effects go continue for centuries. Dese dey include ocean heating, ocean acidification den sea level rise.
Climate change dey threaten people plus increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food den water scarcity, more disease, den economic loss. Human migration den conflict sanso fi be a result. De World Health Organization dey bell climate change one of de biggest threats to global health insyd de 21st century. Societies den ecosystems go experience more severe risks widout action to limit warming. Dey adapt to climate change thru efforts like flood control measures anaa drought-resistant crops partially dey reduce climate change risks, although dem already reach sam limits to adaptation. Poorer communities be responsible for small share of global emissions, yet get de least ability make dem adapt wey dem be most vulnerable to climate change.
Na dem feel chaw climate change impacts insyd recent years, plus 2023 de warmest for record top at +1.48 °C (2.66 °F) since regular tracking begin insyd 1850. Additional warming go increase dese impacts wey dem fi trigger tipping points, such as dey melt all of de Greenland ice sheet. Under de 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agree make dem keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, plus pledges dem make under de Agreement, global warming go still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by de end of de century. Limiting warming to 1.5 °C go require make dem dey halve emissions by 2030 den dey achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
Dem fi phase out fossil fuel use by make dem dey conserve energy den switch to energy sources wey no dey produce significant carbon pollution. Dese energy sources dey include wind, solar, hydro, den nuclear power. Cleanly generated electricity fi replace fossil fuels for make dem dey power transportation, dey heat buildings, den dey run industrial processes. Dem sanso fi komot carbon from de atmosphere, for instance by make dem dey increase forest cover den farming plus methods twey dey capture carbon insyd soil.
