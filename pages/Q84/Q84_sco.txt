Lunnon ([ˈlʌnən]; Inglis: London, [ˈlʌndən]) is the caipital an maist populous ceety o Ingland an the Unitit Kinrick. Staunin on the River Thames, Lunnon haes been a major dounset for twa millennia, its history that gangs back tae its foundin bi the Romans, wha named it Londinium. Lunnon's auncient core, the Ceety o Lunnon, lairgely retains its 1.12-square-mile (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries an in 2011 haed a resident population o 7,375, makin it the smawest ceety in Ingland. Syne the 19t century or mair, the term Lunnon haes referred tae the metropolis developed aroond this core an aa. The bulk o this conurbation forms the Greater Lunnon admeenistrative area (coterminous wi the Lunnon region), govrened bi the Mayor o Lunnon an the Lunnon Assembly.
Lunnon is a leadin global ceety, wi strenths in the arts, commerce, eddication, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research an development, tourism, an transport aw contributing tae its prominence. It is ane o the warld's leadin financial centres an haes the fift-or saxt-lairgest metropolitan area GDP in the warld dependin on measurement. Lunnon is a warld cultural caipital. It is the warld's maist-visitit ceety as measured by international arrivals an haes the warld's lairgest ceety airport system measured bi passenger traffic. Lunnon's 43 varsities form the lairgest concentration o higher education institutes in Europe. In 2012, Lunnon became the first ceety tae host the modren Simmer Olympic Gemmes three times.
Lunnon haes a diverse range o fowk an culturs, an mair nor 300 leids is spoken wiin Greater Lunnon. The Greater Lunnon Authority estimatit its population tae be 8.63 million in 2015, the lairgest o ony municipality in the European Union, an accoonting for 12.5 percent o the UK population. Lunnon's urban area is the seicont maist populous in the EU, efter Paris, wi 9,787,426 indwallers accordin tae the 2011 census. The ceety's metropolitan area is the ane o the maist populous in Europe wi 13,614,409 indwallers, while the Greater Lunnon Authority pits the population o Lunnon metropolitan region at 21 million.
Lunnon wis the warld's maist populous ceety frae aroond 1831 tae 1925.
Lunnon conteens fower Warld Heritage Steids: the Touer o Lunnon; Kew Gardens; the site comprisin the Pailace o Wastmeenster, Westminster Abbey, an St Margaret's Kirk; an the historic dounset o Greenwich (in whilk the Royal Observatory, Greenwich marks the Prime Meridian, 0° langitude, an GMT). Ither famous laundmerks include Buckingham Palace, the Lunnon Ee, Piccadilly Circus, St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Trafalgar squerr, an The Shard. Lunnon is home tae numerous museums, galleries, libraries, sporting events an ither cultural institutions, includin the British Museum, National Gallery, Tate Modern, British Library an 40 West End theatres. The Lunnon Unnergrund is the auldest unnerground railway network in the warld.


== History ==


=== Toponymy ===

The etymology o Lunnon is uncertain. It is an auncient name, foond in soorces frae the 2nt century. It is recorded c. 121 as Londinium, that pynts tae Romano-British origin. The earliest attemptit explanation, nou disregarded, is attributit tae Geoffrey o Monmouth in Historia Regum Britanniae. This haed it that the name originatit frae a supposed Keeng Lud, wha haed allegedly takken ower the ceety an named it Kaerlud.
Frae 1898, it wis commonly acceptit that the name wis o Celtic origin an meant place belangin tae a man cawed *Londinos; this explication haes syne been rejeckit. Richard Coates pit forrit an explication in 1998 that it is derived frae the pre-Celtic Auld European *(p)lowonida, meanin 'burn ower wide for tae ford', an suggestit that this wis a name gien tae the pairt o the River Thames that rins throu Lunnon; frae this, the dounset gained the Celtic form o its name, *Lowonidonjon; this requires quite a serious amendment houiver. The ultimate difficulty lies in reconciling the Latin form Londinium wi the modren Welsh Llundain, that should demand a form *(h)lōndinion (as opposed tae *londīnion), frae earlier *loundiniom. The possibility canna be ruled oot that the Welsh name wis borrowed back in frae Inglis at a later date, an for that raison canna be uised as a basis frae that tae reconstruct the oreeginal name.
Til 1889, the name "Lunnon" offeecially anerly applee'd tae the Ceety o Lunnon but syne then it haes referred tae the Coonty o Lunnon, an nou Greater Lunnon an aa.


=== Prehistory ===
Twa recent discoveries indicate probable vera auld settlements near the Thames in the Lunnon area. In 1999, the remains o a Bronze Age bridge war foond on the foreshore north o Vauxhall Bridge. This brig aither gaed athort the Thames, or gaed tae a nou lost island in the burn. Dendrology datit the timbers tae 1500 BC. In 2010 the foundations o a lairge timmer structur, datit tae 4500 BC, war foond on the Thames foreshore, sooth o Vauxhall Bridge. The function o the mesolithic structur is nae kent. Baith structures are on South Bank, at a naitural crossin pynt whaur the River Effra flows intae the River Thames.


=== Roman Lunnon ===

Tho thare is evidence o scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major dounset wis foondit bi the Romans efter the invasion o 43 AD. This anerly lastit til aroond 61, whan the Iceni tribe led bi Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it tae the grund. The next, heivy planned, incarnation o Londinium prospered an superseded Colchester as the caipital o the Roman province o Britannia in 100. At its hicht in the 2nt century, Roman Lunnon haed a population o aroond 60,000.


=== Anglo-Saxon Lunnon (an Viking period) ===
Wi the collapse o Roman rule in the early 5t century, Lunnon ceased tae be a caipital an the walled ceety o Londinium wis effectively abandoned, awtho Roman civilisation continued in the St Martin-in-the-Fields area until aroond 450. Frae aroond 500, an Anglo-Saxon dounset kent as Lundenwic developed in the same area, slichtly tae the wast o the auld Roman ceety. By aboot 680, it haed revived sufficiently tae become a major port, awtho thare is little evidence o lairge-scale production o goods. Frae the 820s the toun declined acause o repeatit Viking invasions. Thare three recordit Viking assaults on Lunnon; twa o whilk wis wun tae in 851 an 886 AD, tho thay war defeatit in the attack o 994 AD.

The Vikings established Denlaw ower a fair feck o the eastren an northren pairt o Ingland wi its mairch gaun frae aboot Lunnon tae Chester. It wis an area o political an geographical control imposed bi the Viking incursions that wis formally agreed tae bi the Dens warlord, Guthrum an wast-Saxon keeng, Alfred the Great in 886 AD. Denlaw lastit in mony pairts o Ingland for centuries tae come. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle recordit that Lunnon wis "refounded" by Alfred the Great in 886. Archaeological research shows that this involved abandonment o Lundenwic an a revival o life an tred wiin the auld Roman walls. Lunnon then grew slowly until aboot 950, efter whilk activity increased dramatically.
Bi the 11t century, Lunnon wis ayont aw comparison the lairgest toun in Ingland. Wastmeenster Abbey, rebiggit in the Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor, wis ane o the grandest kirks in Europe. Winchester haed aforehaun been the caipital o Anglo-Saxon Ingland, but frae this time on, Lunnon becam the main forum for furren traders an the base for defence in time o war. In the view o Frank Stenton: "It had the resources, an it was rapidly developing the dignity an the political self-consciousness appropriate tae a national capital."


=== Middle Ages ===

Follaein his victory in the Battle o Hastings, William, Duke o Normandy, wis crowned Keeng o Ingland in the newly finished Wastmeenster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066. William biggit the Touer o Lunnon, the first o the mony Norman castles in Ingland tae be rebuilt in stone, in the sootheastren corner o the ceety, tae intimidate the native indwallers. In 1097, William II began the biggin o Wastmeenster Hall, close bi the abbey o the same name. The hall becam the basis o a new Pailace o Wastmeenster.
During the 12t century, the institutions o central government, whilk haed hitherto accompanied the ryal Inglis court as it moved aroond the kintra, grew in size an sophistication an becam increasingly fixed in ane place. In maist cases this wis Wastmeenster, awtho the ryal treasury, haein been moved frae Winchester, came tae rest in the Tower. While the Ceety o Wastmeenster developed intae a true caipital in governmental terms, its distinct neighbour, the ceety o Lunnon, remained Ingland's lairgest ceety an principal commercial centre, an it flourished unner its ain unique admeenistration, the Corporation o Lunnon. In 1100, its population wis aroond 18,000; by 1300 it haed grown tae nearly 100,000.
Disaster struck during the Black Death in the mid-14t century, when Lunnon lost nearly a third o its population. Lunnon wis the focus o the Peasants' Revolt in 1381.


=== Air modren ===

During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift tae Protestantism, wi much o Lunnon passin frae kirk tae private ainership. The traffic in woollen cloths shipped undyed an undressed frae Lunnon tae the nearby shores o the Law Kintras whaur it wis considered indispensable. But the tentacles o English maritime enterprise hardly extendit beyond the seas o north-wast Europe. The commercial route tae Italy an the Mediterranean Sea normally lay throu Antwerp an ower the Alps; ony ships passing throu the Strait o Gibraltar tae or frae England war likely tae be Italian or Ragusan. Upon the re-openin o the Netherlands tae English shipping in Januar 1565 thare at ance ensued a strang outburst o commercial activity. The Royal Exchange wis foondit. Mercantilism grew an monopoly trading companies sic as the East Indie Company war established, wi tred expanding tae the New World. Lunnon becam the principal North Sea port, wi migrants arrivin frae England an abroad. The population rose frae an estimatit 50,000 in 1530 tae aboot 225,000 in 1605.
In the 16t century, William Shakespeare an his contemporaries lived in Lunnon at a time o hostility tae the development o the theatre. By the end o the Tudor period in 1603, Lunnon wis still vera compact. Thare wis an assassination attempt on James I in Westminster, throu the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605. Lunnon wis plagued by disease in the early 17t century, culminatin in the Great Plague o 1665–1666, whilk killt up tae 100,000 bodies, or a fift o the population.
The Great Fire o Lunnon broke oot in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the ceety an quickly swept throu the widden biggins. Rebiggin teuk ower ten year an wis supervised by Robert Hooke as Surveyor o Lunnon. In 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral wis completit. During the Georgian era new destricts sic as Mayfair war formed in the wast; an new brigs ower the Thames encouraged development in South Lunnon. In the east, the Port o Lunnon expanded downstream.
In 1762, George III acquired Buckingham House an it wis enlairged ower the next 75 year. During the 18t century, Lunnon wis dogged by crime an the Bow Street Runners war established in 1750 as a professional police force. In tot, mair nor 200 offences war punishable by death, includin petty theft. Most childer born in the ceety died afore reakin thair third birthday. The coffeehouse became a popular place tae debate ideas, wi growin literacy an the development o the prentin press makkin news widely available; an Fleet Street became the centre o the British press.
Accordin tae Samuel Johnson:

Ye cannae fin a man, at aw intellectual, wha is willin tae leave Lunnon. Naw, Sir, whan a man is fauchelt Lunnon, he is tired o life; for there in Lunnon aw that life can afford.


=== Late modren an contemporary ===

Lunnon wis the warld's lairgest ceety frae aboot 1831 tae 1925. Lunnon's overcrowded conditions led tae cholera epidemics, claimin 14,000 lifes in 1848, an 6,000 in 1866. risin traffic congestion led tae the creation o the warld's first local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board o Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the caipital an some surroondin counties; it wis abolished in 1889 when the Lunnon County cooncil wis creatit oot o those areas o the counties surroondin the caipital. Lunnon wis bombed bi the Germans during the First World War while during the Seicont World War the Blitz an ither bombin bi the German Luftwaffe killed ower 30,000 Lunnoners an destroyed lairge tracts o housing an ither biggins athort the ceety. Immediately efter the war, the 1948 Simmer Olympics war held at the oreeginal Wembley Stadium, at a time when Lunnon haed barely recovered frae the war.
In 1951, the Festeeval o Britain wis held on the Sooth Bank. The Great Smog o 1952 led tae the Clean Air Act 1956, that endit the "pea soup fogs" for whilk Lunnon haed been notorious. Frae the 1940s onwart, Lunnon became hame tae numerous immigrants, lairgely frae Commonweel countries lik Jamaica, Indie, Bangladesh an Pakistan, makkin Lunnon ane o the maist diverse ceeties in Europe.

Primarily stairtin in the mid-1960s, Lunnon becam a centre for the warldwide youth cultur, exemplified bi the Swinging Lunnon subculture associatit wi the Keeng's Road, Chelsea an Carnaby Street. The role o trendsetter wis revived in the punk era. In 1965 Lunnon's political boundaries wis expandit tae tak intae accoont the growthe o the urban area an a new Greater Lunnon cooncil wis creatit. Throu The Troubles in Northren Ireland, Lunnon wis subjectit tae bombin attacks bi the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality wis hielichtit bi the 1981 Brixton riot.
Greater Lunnon's population declined steadily in the decades efter the Seicont World War, frae an estimatit peak o 8.6 million in 1939 tae aroond 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for Lunnon moved downstream tae Felixstowe an Tilbury, wi the Lunnon Docklands area becomin a focus for regeneration, includin the Canary Wharf development. This wis borne oot o Lunnon's ever-increasin role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s. The Thames Barrier wis completit in the 1980s tae pertect Lunnon against tidal surges frae the North Sea.
The Greater Lunnon cooncil wis abolished in 1986, whilk left Lunnon as the anerly lairge metropolis in the warld wioot a central admeenistration. In 2000, Lunnon-wide govrenment wis restored, wi the creation o the Greater Lunnon Authority. tae celebrate the stairt o the 21st century, the Millennium Dome, Lunnon Eye an Millennium Bridge war biggit. On 6 Julie 2005 Lunnon wis awairdit the 2012 Simmer Olympics, makkin Lunnon the first ceety tae stage the Olympic Gemmes three times. The naxt day (7 Julie 2005) Lunnon's tube network wis hit bi major bomb attacks. In Februar 2015, Greater Lunnon's population wis estimatit tae be 8.6 million, the heichest level syne 1939.

Template:Politics o Lunnon


=== Local government ===

The admeenistration o Lunnon is formed o twa tiers—a ceety-wide, strategic tier an a local tier. ceety-wide admeenistration is coordinatit bi the Greater Lunnon Authority (GLA), while local admeenistration is carried oot by 33 smawer authorities. The GLA consists o twa electit components; the Mayor o Lunnon, wha haes executive powers, an the Lunnon Assembly, whilk scrutinises the mayor's decisions an can accept or reject the mayor's budget proposals ilka year.
The headquarters o the GLA is City Hall, Southwark; the mayor is Sadiq Khan. The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the Lunnon Plan, whilk daed it's maist recent revision in 2011. The local authorities are the cooncils o the 32 Lunnon boroughs an the City o Lunnon Corporation. Thay are responsible for maist local services, sic as local planning, schuils, social services, local roads an refuse collection. Certaint functions, sic as waste management, are providit throu jynt arrangements. In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by Lunnon cooncils an the GLA amountit tae juist ower £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs an £7.4 billion for the GLA).
Policing in Greater Lunnon, except the City o Lunnon, is providit bi the Metropolitan Police Force, overseen bi the Mayor throu the Mayor's Office for Policing an Crime (MOPAC). The ceety o Lunnon haes its ain police force – the City o Lunnon Police. The British Transport Police are responsible for police services on National Rail an Lunnon Unnergrund services.
The Lunnon Fire Brigade is the statutory fire an rescue service for Greater Lunnon. It is run bi the Lunnon Fire an Emergency Planning Authority an is the third lairgest fire service in the warld. National Health Service ambulance services are providit bi the Lunnon Ambulance Service (LAS) NHS Trust, the lairgest free-at-the-pynt-o-uise emergency ambulance service in the warld. The Lunnon Air Ambulance charity operates in conjunction wi the LAS whaur required. Her Majesty's Coastguard an the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate on the River Thames, whilk is unner the jurisdiction o the Port o Lunnon Authority frae Teddington Lock tae the sea.


=== National government ===
Lunnon is the seat o the Govrenment o the Unitit Kinrick. Mony govrenment departments are based close tae the Pailace o Wastmeenster, parteecularly alang Whitehall, includin the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. The British Parliament is eften referred tae as the "Mother o Parliaments" (awtho this sobriquet wis first applied tae England itself by John Bright) acause it haes been the model for maist ither parliamentary systems. Thare are 73 Members o Parliament (MPs) frae Lunnon, who correspond tae local parliamentary constituencies in the national Parliament. As o Juin 2017, 49 are frae the Labour Party, 21 are Conservatives, an 3 are Liberal Democrat.

=== Scope ===

Greater Lunnon is the tap-level administrative subdiveesion coverin Lunnon. The wee, ancient City o Lunnon at its core ance contained the hale dounset, but as the urban area grew the City Corporation resistit attemps tae amalgamate it wi its suburbs, causin "Lunnon" tae be defined in a nummer weys for different purposes. Forty per cent o Greater Lunnon is covered bi the Lunnon post toun, wiin whilk 'Lunnon' forms pairt o postal addresses.
The Lunnon telephone area code (020) covers a lairger area, seemilar in size tae Greater Lunnon, awtho some outer destricts are omeetit an some places juist ootside are included. The Greater Lunnon boundary haes been aligned tae the M25 motorway in places.
Outward urban expansion is nou preventit bi the Metropolitan Green Belt,  awtho the biggit-up area extends beyond the boundary in places, resultin in a separately defined Greater Lunnon Urban area. Beyond this is the vast Lunnon commuter belt. Greater Lunnon is split for some purposes intae Inner Lunnon an Outer Lunnon. The ceety is split bi the River Thames intae North an South, wi an informal central Lunnon area in its interior. The coordinates o the nominal centre o Lunnon, tradeetionally considered tae be the oreeginal Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction o Trafalgar squerr an Whitehall, are approximately 51°30′26″N 00°07′39″W.


=== Status ===
Athin Lunnon, baith the City o Lunnon an the City o Westminster hae ceety status an baith the ceety o Lunnon an the remainder o Greater Lunnon is the ceremonial counties. The area o Greater Lunnon haes incorporatit area that war ance pairt o the historic counties o Middlesex, Kent, Surrey, Essex an Hertfordshire. Lunnon's status as the caipital o England, an later the Unitit Kinrick, haes never been grantit or confirmed offeecially—by statute or in written form.
Its poseetion wis formed throu constitutional convention, makkin its status as de facto caipital a pairt o the UK's unwritten constitution. The caipital o Ingland wis moved tae Lunnon frae Winchester as the Pailace o Wastmeenster developed in the 12t an 13t centuries tae become the permanent location o the royal court, an sicweys the political caipital o the naition. Mair recently, Greater Lunnon haes been defined as a region o England an in this context is kent as Lunnon.


=== Topography ===

Greater Lunnon encompasses a tot area o 1,583 square kilometre (611 sq mi), an area that haed a population o 7,172,036 in 2001 an a population density o 4,542 inhabitants per square kilometre (11,760/sq mi). The extendit area kent as the Lunnon Metropolitan Region or the Lunnon Metropolitan Agglomeration, comprises a tot area o 8,382 square kilometre (3,236 sq mi) haes a population o 13,709,000 an a population density o 1,510 inhabitants per square kilometre (3,900/sq mi).  Modern Lunnon stauns on the Thames, its primary geographical featur, a navigable river whilk crosses the ceety frae the sooth-wast tae the east. The Thames Valley is a floodplain surroondit by gently rolling hills includin Parliament Hill, Addington Hills, an Primrose Hill. The Thames wis ance a fair bit broader, shallaer burn wi extensive marshlands; at heich tide, its shores reakit five times thair present width.
Syne the Victorian era the Thames haes been extensively embanked, an mony o its Lunnon tributaries nou flow unnerground. The Thames is a tidal river, an Lunnon is vulnerable tae flooding. The threat haes increased ower time acause o a slaw but continuous rise in heich watter level bi the slow 'tilting' o Britain (up in the north an doun in the sooth) caused by post-glacial rebound.
In 1974, a decade o work began on the construction o the Thames Barrier athort the Thames at Woolwich tae deal wi this threat. While the barrier is expectit tae function as designed til aboot 2070, concepts for its future enlairgement or redesign is awready bein discussed.


=== Climate ===

Lunnon haes a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb ), seemilar tae aw o soothren Britain. Maugre its reputation as bein a rainy ceety, Lunnon receives less precipitation (601 mm (24 in) in a year), than Roum, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Naples an even Sydney in Australie. Temperature extremes for aw sites in the Lunnon area range frae 38.1 °C (100.6 °F) at Kew during August 2003  doun tae −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) at Northolt during Januar 1962.
Simmers are generally warm an whiles het, Lunnon's average Julie heich is 24 °C (75.2 °F). On average, Lunnon will see 31 days abuin 25 °C (77.0 °F) ilka year, an 4.2 days abuin 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) ilka year. Throu the 2003 European heat wave thare war 14 consecutive days abuin 30 °C (86.0 °F) an 2 consecutive days whaur temperatures reakit 38 °C (100.4 °F), leadin tae hunners o heat relatit daiths. Winters are generally cuil an damp wi little temperature variation. Snowfall daes occur frae time tae time, an can cause traivel disruption whan this happens. Spring an hairst are mixed seasons an can be leesome. As a lairge ceety, Lunnon haes a considerable urban heat island effect, makkin the centre o Lunnon at times 5 °C (9 °F) warmer than the suburbs an outskirts. The effect o this can be seen ablo whan comparin Lunnon Heathrow that is locatit 15 mile wast o Lunnon wi the Lunnon Weather Centre that is locatit in the centre o Lunnon.


=== destricts ===

Lunnon's vast urban area is aften descrievit uisin a set o destrict names, lik Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley an Whitechapel. Thay are aither informal designations, reflect the names o villages that hae been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units sic as parishes or umwhile boroughs.
Siclike names hae remained in uise throu tradeetion, ilk o thaim referrin tae a local area wi its ain distinctive character, but wioot official boundaries. Syne 1965 Greater Lunnon haes been dividit intae 32 Lunnon boroughs in addition tae the ancient ceety o Lunnon. The ceety o Lunnon is the main financial destrict, an Canary Wharf haes recently developed intae a new financial an commercial hub in the Docklands tae the east.
The West End is Lunnon's main entertainment an shoppin destrict, attracting tourists. West Lunnon includes expensive residential areas whaur properties can sell for tens o millions o pounds. The average price for properties in Kensington an Chelsea is ower £2 million wi a seimilarly heich outlay in maist o central Lunnon.
The East End is the area closest tae the oreeginal Port o Lunnon, kent for its heich immigrant population, as weel as for bein ane o the puirest areas in Lunnon. The surroondin East Lunnon area saw a fair bit o Lunnon's early industrial development; nou, brownfield sites throughout the area are bein redeveloped as pairt o the Thames Gateway includin the Lunnon Riverside an Lower Lea Valley, that wis developed intae the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics an Paralympics.


=== Architecture ===

Lunnon's biggins are ower diverse tae be characterised by ony parteecular architectural style, partly acause o thair varyin ages. Mony grand houses an public biggins, sic as the National Gallery, are biggit frae Portland stone. Some areas o the ceety, parteecularly those juist wast o the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed biggins. Few structures in central Lunnon pre-date the Great Fire o 1666, thir bein a few trace Roman remains, the Tower o Lunnon an a few scattered Tudor survivors in the ceety. Faur oot is, for insample, the Tudor period Hampton Court Palace, England's auldest surviving Tudor palace, biggit by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey c. 1515.
Wren's late 17t-century kirks an the financial institutions o the 18t an 19t centuries lik the Royal Exchange an the Bank o England, tae the early 20t century Old Bailey an the 1960s Barbican Estate form pairt o the varied architectural heritage.

The disuised, but suin tae be rejuvenated, 1939 Battersea Power Station bi the burn in the sooth-wast is a local laundmerk, while some railway termini are excellent insamples o Victorian architecture, maist notably St. Pancras an Paddington. The density o Lunnon varies, wi heich employment density in the central area, heich residential densities in inner Lunnon an laicher densities in Outer Lunnon.
The Monument in the ceety o Lunnon provides views o the surroondin areas while commemoratin the Great Fire o Lunnon, whilk originatit fae a biggin naurhaun. Marble Arch an Wellington Arch, at the north an sooth ends o Park Lane respectively, hae royal connections, as dae the Albert Memorial an Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar squerr, ane o the focal pynts o the ceety centre. Older biggins are mainly brick biggit, maist commonly the yellae Lunnon stock brick or a warm orange-red variety, eften decoratit wi carvings an white plaster mouldings.
In the dense airts, maist o the concentration is via medium- an heich-rise biggins. Lunnon's skyscrapers lik 30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower an One Canada squerr are maistly in the twa financial destricts, the City o Lunnon an Canary Wharf. High-rise development is restrictit at certaint sites if it wad obstruct pertectit views o St Paul's Cathedral an ither historic biggins. Housomeiver, thare a nummer o verra heich skyscrapers in central Lunnon (see Tall biggins in Lunnon), includin the 72-storey Shard Lunnon Bridge, the heichest biggin in the European Union.
Other notable modern biggins include City Hall in Southwark wi its distinctive oval shape, an the British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross. What wis formerly the Millennium Dome, bi the Thames tae the east o Canary Wharf, is nou an entertainment venue cried The O2 Arena.


=== Natural history ===
The Lunnon Natural History Society suggest that Lunnon is "one o the World's Greenest ceeties" wi mair nor 40 percent green space or open watter. Thay indicate that 2000 species o flowering plant hae been foond growin thare an that the tidal Thames supports 120 species o fish. Thay forby state that ower 60 species o bird nest in central Lunnon an that thair members hae recordit 47 species o butterflee, 1173 moths an mair nor 270 kinds o speeder aroond Lunnon. Lunnon's wetland airts support nationally important populations o mony watter birds. Lunnon haes 38 Sites o Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), twa National Nature Reserves an 76 Local Nature Reserves.
Amphibians are common in the caipital, includin smooth newts livin bi the Tate Modern, an common frogs, common toads, palmate newts an great crestit newts, housamiver, native reptiles lik slow-worms, common lizards, grass snakes an adders, are maistly anly seen in outer Lunnon.

Amang ither indwallers o Lunnon are 10,000 tods, sae that thare are nou 16 tods for every squerr mile (2.6 squerr kilometres) o Lunnon. Thir urban tods are noticeably bolder than thair kintra cousins, sharin the pavement (sidewalk) wi pedestrians an raisin cubs in people's backyards. Tods hae even sneaked intae the Houses o Parliament, whaur ane wis foond asleep on a filing cabinet. Anither broke intae the grunds o Buckingham Palace, reportedly killin some o Queen Elizabeth II's prized pink flamingos. Generally, housamiver, tods an ceety folk appear tae get alang. A survey in 2001 bi the Lunnon-based Mammal Society foond that 80 percent o Lunnoners liked haein them aroond.
Other mammals foond in Greater Lunnon are hedgehogs, rats, mice, rabbit, shrew, vole, an squirrels,  In wilder areas o Outer Lunnon, sic as Epping Forest, a wide variety o mammals are foond includin hare, brock, field, bank an watter laund-moose, wid moose, yellae-neck moose, mowdiwarp, shrew, an wheasel, in addition tae tod, squirrel an hurcheon.
