James Prescott Joule FRS (24 December 1818 â€“ 11 October 1889) wis an Inglis physicist an brewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. Joule studied the naitur o heat, an discovered its relationship tae mechanical wirk. This led tae the law o conservation o energy, which led to the development o the first law o thermodynamics. The SI derived unit o energy, the joule, is named efter James Joule. He wirked wi Laird Kelvin tae develop the absolute scale o temperatur the kelvin. Joule an aa made observations o magnetostriction, an he foond the relationship atween the current throu a resistor an the heat dissipatit, which is nou called Joule's first law.
