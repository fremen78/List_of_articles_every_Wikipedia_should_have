Current is the wird that's uised for the flow o electric charge meisured in Amperes.
The equation o current is:

  
    
      
        I
        =
        
          
            
              Δ
              Q
            
            
              Δ
              t
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle I={\frac {\Delta Q}{\Delta t}}}
  

where
I is the current flowin

  
    
      
        Δ
        Q
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta Q}
  
 is the chynge in electric chairge

  
    
      
        Δ
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta t}
  
 is the chynge in time
