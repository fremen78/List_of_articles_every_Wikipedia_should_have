A transistor is a semiconductor device uised tae amplify an switch electronic signals an electrical pouer. It is componed o semiconductor material wi at least three terminals for connection tae an freemit circuit. A voltage or current applee'd tae ane pair o the transistor's terminals chynges the current throu anither pair o terminals. Acause the controlled (ootput) pouer can be heicher than the controllin (input) pouer, a transistor can amplify a signal. The day, some transistors are packaged individually, but mony mair are foond embedded in integratit circuits.
The transistor is the fundamental biggin block o modren electronic devices, an is ubiquitous in modren electronic seestems. Follaein its development in 1947 bi John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, an William Shockley, the transistor revolutionized the field o electronics, an paved the wey for smawer an cheaper radios, calculators, an computers, amang ither things.  The transistor is on the leet o IEEE milestones in electronics, an the inventors wur jyntly awairdit the 1956 Nobel Prize in Pheesics for thair achievement.
