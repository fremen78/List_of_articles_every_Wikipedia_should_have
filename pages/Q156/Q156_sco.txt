In chemistry, an alcohol is an organic compoond in which the hydroxyl functional group (-O H) is boond tae a carbon atom. The term alcohol oreeginally referred tae the primar alcohol ethanol (ethyl alcohol), that is uised as a drog an is the main alcohol present in alcoholic beverages.
The suffix -ol appears in the IUPAC chemical name o aw substances whaur the hydroxyl group is the functional group wi the heichest priority; in substances whaur a heicher priority group is present the prefix hydroxy- will appear in the International Union o Pure an Applee'd Chemistry (IUPAC) name. The suffix -ol in nan-systematic names (such as paracetamol or cholesterol) an aa teepically indicates that the substance includes a hydroxyl functional group an, sae, can be termed an alcohol. But mony substances, pairticularly succars (ensaumples glucose an sucrose) conteen hydroxyl functional groups withoot uisin the suffix. An important cless o alcohols, o that methanol an ethanol are the semplest members is the saturatit straicht cheen alcohols, the general formula for that is CnH2n+1OH.
