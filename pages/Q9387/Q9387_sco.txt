Weber is eften citit, wi Émile Durkheim an Karl Marx, as amang the three foonders o sociology. Weber wis a key proponent o methodological antipositivism, arguin for the study o social action throu interpretive (rather nor purely empiricist) means, based on unnerstaundin the purpose an meanin that indiveeduals attach tae thair ain actions. Unlik Durkheim, he did nae believe in monocausality an rather proponed that for ony ootcome thare can be multiple causes.
