The calendar in maist widespread uise today is the Gregorian calendar, introduced in the 16t century bi Pape Gregory XIII as a modification o the Julian calendar, which wis itsel a modification o the auncient Roman calendar.
The term calendar itsel is taken frae calendae, the term for the first day o the month in the Roman calendar, relatit tae the verb calare "tae cry oot", referrin tae the "cryin" o the new muin when it wis first seen.
Laitin calendarium meant "accoont beuk, register" (as accoonts war settled an debts war collected on the calends o each month). The Laitin term wis adoptit in Auld French as calendier.
