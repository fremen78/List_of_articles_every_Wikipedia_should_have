In most humans, it also houses the nosehairs, which catch airborne particles and prevent them from reaching the lungs.  Within and behind the nose is the olfactory mucosa and the sinuses.  Behind the nasal cavity, air next passes through the pharynx, shared with the digestive system, and then into the rest of the respiratory system. In humans, the nose is located centrally on the face; on most other mammals, it is on the upper tip of the snout.
