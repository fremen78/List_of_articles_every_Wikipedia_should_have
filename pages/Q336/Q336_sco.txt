Scientists compete wi ilk ither. Scientists checka ilk ither's wark. Scientists tries tae mak better explanations for the data.
Scientists publishes thair wark in peer-reviewed jurnals.
Science is a wey for tae learn aboot things bi discardin whit isna true. 
Scientists maun be gey canny tae mak explanations that fits weel wi whit thay observe an meisur. Thay compete tae fend better explanations. An explanation micht be interestin or pleasin, but if it daesn gree wi whit ither scientists really sees an meisurs, thay will try tae find a better explanation.
Ither scientists checks thair ideas for tae see if the real observations, meisurments, an tests shaws if thay are richt or wrang. Peer review an repeatin experiments is the ae wey tae be shuir the knawledge is richt.
Science maks models o naitur, models o oor universe, an medicine. Thare's mony sindry sciences wi thair ain names. Houaniver it isna richt tae say "science says" ony ae thing. Science is a process, no juist the facts an rules believed at ae time.
