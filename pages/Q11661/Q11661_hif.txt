Dear Potential Donors,
We are reaching out on behalf of the toxico-lactological foundation "Lactology" in the hope that you would consider supporting our unique initiative to create the world’s first toxico-lactological database. Our project aims to provide free, reliable, and scientifically validated information on which medications, herbs, and supplements may pose a risk of toxicity to newborns when taken by breastfeeding mothers.

Currently, our team consists of only two people working tirelessly to develop and expand this database. However, to fully complete this project over the next four years, we need to hire an additional seven experts, including pharmacists, a database administrator, and general technical personnel. This would allow us to finish the database and make it accessible to mothers worldwide, ensuring safer breastfeeding practices and healthier babies.
The total funding required for this endeavor is approximately €500,000. These funds will cover the salaries and resources necessary to establish a dedicated and skilled team who can ensure that our database is comprehensive, regularly updated, and remains a reliable source of information for parents, healthcare professionals, and researchers.

Your support would not only help us complete this important project, but it would also contribute to creating a lower-toxic world, ultimately resulting in healthier babies and a brighter future. We welcome donations through bank transfer, and I will provide our foundation’s account details upon request.
Thank you for considering this opportunity to be part of a truly meaningful cause.
