Ek magnet (Greek μαγνήτις λίθος magnḗtis líthos, "Magnesian stone" se) ek material nai to object hae jon ki magnetic field produce kare hae. Ii magnetic field dekhae nai hae lekin ek magnet ke khaas property ke kaaran hae : ek force jin ki  ferromagnetic materials, jaise kiiron ke attract kare hae, aur duusra magane ke repel kare hae.

Chapter 9 discusses magnets and their magnetic fields using the concept of magnetic poles, but it also gives evidence that magnetic poles do not really exist in ordinary matter. Chapters 10 and 11, following what appears to be a 19th-century approach, use the pole concept to obtain the laws describing the magnetism of electric currents.
