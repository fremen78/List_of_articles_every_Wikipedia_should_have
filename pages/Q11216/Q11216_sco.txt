Numerical analysis is an area thon studies computer algorithms tae get approximate solutions for mathematical problems. It is usit tae compute integrals an solvin pairtial differential equations. It can also solve problems i linear algebra. Today, thare are many famous numerical analysts such as Leonid Kantorovich.
